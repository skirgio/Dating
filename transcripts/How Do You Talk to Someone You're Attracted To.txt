today I am listening and I brought in a 
good friend of mine and he's also in the 
dating space for those of you who don't 
know Tripp is an international dating 
coach for men and he created a system 
called the Ted system to help shy men 
confidently attract the women they 
desire so so Ted is tension which means 
building sexual tension how do you build 
sexual tension very simple okay eye 
contact is a great way to start eye 
contact okay being more of a challenge 
to a woman so if you're kind of chasing 
her or you're showing too much interest 
then the sexual tension dies so you have 
to be a little bit of a challenge right 
to play cool yeah and then just general 
flirting like you know you tease her a 
little bit you kind of play a little bit 
it's like the antidote to the nice guy
