don't wait for something to happen to 
you like getting cancer or going through 
a divorce or losing someone you love to 
do the things that you want to do and 
show up differently in life and um don't 
wait for it so I think that's my driving 
force in terms of helping people 
navigate change our friend Susan has 
coined me the champion of change because 
sometimes we do need a champion to 
believe in all the things that you can 
do and I just help people remind I help 
remind people that they have it in them 
and we believe so often in our friends 
and our family and our loved ones and do 
we give the same reciprocity to our own 
belief about ourselves and often we 
don't and I learn the hard way
