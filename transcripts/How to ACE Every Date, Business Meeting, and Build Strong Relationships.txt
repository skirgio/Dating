[Music] 
welcome to the Smart dating Academy 
podcast I'm Bella Grande the founder of 
Smart dating Academy and your host I 
started Smart dating Academy in 2009 
because I had this crazy Knack of giving 
people dating advice that actually 
worked that I took I've been married for 
almost 25 years and now my company helps 
people to date smarter and to find love 
this podcast is meant to bring more love 
into your life no matter where you are 
and what you do and we're here to bring 
more life into your love 
smart daters welcome back to this week's 
episode I hope you've had an amazing 
week and as always you know me I'm super 
excited jumping out of my skin about 
this conversation I'm going to share 
with you with someone that I met 
professionally through a friend that has 
now also become a friend his name is 
Larry Kaufman and he's on here to talk 
about just his whole ethos his way of 
being his way of showing up in the world 
and he wrote a book about how he is and 
what he does that's made him so 
successful and authentic and it's called 
the NCG Factor okay it's called a 
formula for building life-changing 
relationships from college to dating to 
relationships to retirement so I added a 
little bit to your title Larry so I want 
to bring you on so thank you for being 
with us today we're so excited to have 
you 
I am excited to be here Bella thank you 
so much 
so Larry is a senior executive he's 
super smart he was introduced to me by 
my friend Megan and to say that Larry 
leaves you with this conversation I 
didn't know when he and I would connect 
my friend Megan just said he's a great 
connector I think you'll enjoy your 
conversation and I thought okay well I 
love connecting with people and I left 
the conversation going wow what a 
thorough and authentic gentleman who 
asked me what can I do to help you Bella 
and normally I'm the helper I'm The 
Giver look what I do for work so to have 
somebody ask me that was so rare and so 
memorable and since that time Larry 
wrote this book so Larry tell us your 
book is a bestseller on Amazon you have 
you have a story as to how you became 
the NCG Master tell me what inspired you 
to do this and what inspired you to 
write the book so just basically tell us 
your story 
so my story is I wasn't always this 
giving 
connected person and and helping others 
and so if you you said that title I know 
you worked at the dating component 
I always do that I appreciate that and 
there is a a part of it too and so I 
started out thinking 
I'd write something to help kids in 
college because when I go back to my 
college days 
I wasn't a giving guy I was a guy that 
liked to party and have fun I wasn't 
helping others I couldn't tutor anybody 
it would be tutoring them on things that 
wouldn't help them in life so I thought 
if I can go back in time we always talk 
about that we'd go back to our younger 
self well what would we do what could we 
do so I wrote this book thinking I could 
help other kids 
enter college and that'd be for you it 
could be for others that are mid-career 
later in life all the way to retirement 
and so the the inspiration was 
wanting to kind of take what I learned 
and share with others and then it seemed 
to spread Beyond you know college and 
then I was thinking I'll write it and I 
kept saying I was going to write it you 
know we procrastinate we say we're gonna 
do something we don't do it my wife got 
sick of hearing me say that all the time 
and I was I was investing in these 
startups that have gone absolutely 
nowhere and my wife one day said stop 
sinking money into these startups that 
go nowhere and she said we should invest 
in you and I thought that was really 
nice I said write that goddamn book 
absolutely 
I'm just telling a Verbatim this what 
she said I love that and I love your 
wife already and we're going to come 
back to how you met your wife but tell 
us in simple terms what is the NCG 
Factor 
so as you alluded to it's this formula 
for building these life-changing 
relationships so what I'd like to talk 
about is how to be a giver how to be a 
connector and help other people and I 
kind of redefine networking so a lot of 
us show up to events and one-to-one 
meetings and it's it's not it's not 
really as meaningful as it could and 
should be it's kind of going through the 
motions and you know you go to an event 
that you're passing out cards and 
collecting them and you know and then 
tossing a bunch out I don't like that 
but love Bella but hate that person hate 
that person so I redefined how we 
Network 
you know kind of more authentically and 
how we become givers because a lot of 
people work really hard putting a lot of 
hours and I find so many that are not 
philanthropic they're not giving to a 
charity or of their time their expertise 
it's not all about money and and then 
also about becoming a connector which 
not everyone thinks about that so I 
wanted to help people understand the 
power behind being that connector that 
giver and networking in a very different 
way 
so how can we be better connectors right 
life we know that our happiness as human 
beings as evidenced by the Harvard Grant 
study and so many other research studies 
is our happiness as human beings comes 
down to our relationships and the 
quality and the depth of our 
relationships how do we become better 
connectors 
well thanks for asking and you are the 
expert on relationships 
but I think you know given where we're 
at and going through a pandemic 
I think it's it's been a different type 
of world today that we are more 
compassionate 
and being that we're in a different 
world and we're more compassionate we 
have more time because we're we're 
virtual more so than we ever have been 
and we have more time in our calendars 
to become a better connector you have to 
become a better listener 
that ties to relationships 
and a lot of people don't like to ask 
questions they like to as I put in my 
book if you remember reading this people 
like to show up and throw up 
and actually a neighbor who's divorced 
went on a date and said you know good 
looking gentlemen 
very nice 
and we spent hours together where he 
talked all about himself 
and it could have been a connection a 
great connection 
didn't ask anything about her 
and this happens in business and it 
happens in our personal relationships 
too it happens in dating every day to my 
clients and to your point women complain 
all the time their number one complaint 
about men is he didn't ask me one 
question about myself 
and this isn't just you know Titans of 
industry or people you might say well 
that person's maybe more c-suite 
narcissistic self-absorbed this runs the 
gamut and women it's their number one 
complaint so when we coach men it's like 
my tidbit I love show up and throw up 
it's if you've heard your own voice for 
more than five minutes it's time to give 
the other person a turn 
really is and you know and you ask how 
do you become a better connector well 
it's it's asking really good questions 
and learning about the other person and 
even in business I'm learning about 
people personally and professionally we 
caught up before our podcast today 
talking about our families and when you 
learn something about someone's family 
something that's happening in their 
world something that impacted them from 
the pandemic what have you the more that 
you learn the more that you can find a 
way to be a connector and that's how 
I've become a connector professionally 
and I've helped people in their personal 
lives too with many different things 
so it's asking good questions but it's 
it's listening and this transcends into 
business and personal I teach my teams 
this that 
you gotta learn about people it's people 
are so eager in business to just talk 
all about what they do I I had a call 
with an executive a CEO in New Jersey it 
was virtual and we had a great 
conversation and he was upset that I 
asked so much about him 
he said we have to have a second 
conversation again because you were 
asking all about me I and normally the 
tables are turned where I'm inquiring 
about the other person but today you 
threw me off guard where you're asking 
about all about me and learning all 
about me 
and we have to have another conversation 
I want to learn about you 
wow and how did he feel about that well 
I think he he felt good it was nice that 
he was able to share and he he's really 
you know been through a lot in his world 
and we got very personal 
and he shared a lot with me and he said 
he shared some personal things with me 
in the first meeting in the second 
meeting and he just said because of the 
way that 
I got to know him and it put him at ease 
and he shared things that he rarely ever 
shares with anybody and I barely know 
him but I I'd like to get to know people 
and that's how you Foster and build 
relationships in your personal life 
in your marriage when you're dating and 
from a business standpoint 
and you walk in Larry to every 
interaction with that I want to listen 
and I want to get to know this person 
right and that guides you and how this 
might be a strange question I I kind of 
think it's kind of like people everybody 
thinks they're a good driver everybody 
thinks they're a good listener is there 
like how do you know that you're 
actually a good listener and that you're 
listening to a person in the way they 
want to be heard 
I think you're a good listener 
and and I tell this to folks in in on my 
team people on sales too 
if you ask good questions and you hear 
about it and then you feedback how you 
can help them with things that they 
shared with your with you you're a good 
listener right because you're you're not 
just saying here's what we do you're 
saying Bella based upon what you said in 
your business and how you help people 
you know build relationships this is how 
we can help you I know I'm a good 
listener because I've heard something 
and you said your daughter's at this 
University doing this and hey I could be 
helpful if she'd like to do that 
well you're you're going to be attentive 
because I I fed back something you 
shared with me so I know I'm a good 
listener because I take copious notes 
when I talk to people 
but I'm listening and I'm I'm feeding it 
back to them what they shared with me 
and people are more likely to listen to 
you on a date or in business if you take 
what they shared with you and share it 
back 
in some some manner whether it's a story 
or just something you heard or oh when 
you said that I did this years ago or I 
could help you with that 
I love that because it's not just you 
and I don't even know if you were aware 
that you did this but you you listen 
with the intention to give 
so not only are you hearing people 
but you're hearing for an intention of 
how can I be of service to you 
right and how lovely is that and how 
many of us do not walk into interactions 
with that right we're so tired of being 
taken from and being wrung out by people 
that we walk into this we walk into 
interactions with our guard up 
well we do I think if if we walk into a 
meeting with someone 
and we're expecting something in return 
we want business something out of it 
that's the wrong way to approach it and 
and yes I know like I have a team that 
needs to bring in business or I'm out of 
a job but 
but I think if we think about the other 
person first 
and get to know them we build a deeper 
relationship and it will come and it's 
amazing when I take the approach to 
learn about people and I hit them 
personally and and I'm real about that I 
want to 
and also they're like well Larry tell me 
again what you do you know what we have 
a need for what you do but if uh you 
know and I this is my quote and I share 
this in the speaking engagements I have 
if you lead with yourself 
you will leave with yourself 
oh my God I know you're writing it down 
I saw that I saw that on your business 
dating post that I loved a few weeks ago 
right if you lead with yourself you will 
leave with yourself I mean from a dating 
perspective from a business perspective 
how brilliant is that and it's so true 
when you go in and you listen with 
empathy you listen to really understand 
this person where they're coming from 
the road that they've walked and you 
listen with the purpose of helping them 
that's fantastic and now how we can see 
how this could work in the professional 
world right you meet someone from 
networking purposes okay you and I meet 
okay Larry how can I help you and you 
might think okay Bella you know I've 
looked through your LinkedIn Network and 
maybe you could connect me with these 
five people right now on a date is this 
a mindset that that we could come in 
with and how have you seen this play out 
I know you've got some great stories 
even in the dating world 
well I think it's you can use it on a 
date right and you can use it to get a 
date 
right so I'm so I am a connector 
professionally and personally 
now I can't speak to being out of date 
because I'm married so that we have to 
go back in time but on a date 
whether maybe it's going south you know 
you could still Foster relationship 
people are interesting you never know 
you may go on a date and it's not a love 
connection but that becomes a great 
relationship or friend and so take that 
opportunity to ask good questions and 
learn you never know that person you 
want to date with is like you know what 
I know this isn't a love connection but 
my roommate is based on what you told me 
today you know I think maybe a good fit 
for my roommate but if you're if you're 
leading with yourself you're leaving 
with yourself you're not having that 
opportunity and you know for myself I 
like asking really good questions about 
people 
personally and professionally because I 
may learn that they're divorced recently 
or you know three years they have been 
on a date and so 
I'm asking questions and you would think 
like I'm going to lean towards the 
business side but I'm going towards the 
personal side tell me more if you 
haven't been on a date in three years 
you have no significant other how are 
you doing how is it post pandemic to 
date oh it's brutal 
I just listened to Bella's podcast so I 
got some good tips 
it's not so brutal you guys Peak dating 
Seasons coming up it is it's but you 
know what you gotta use all types of you 
know methods and relationships to help 
you so I like learning about people 
professionally and personally because I 
like connecting them 
you know to things that they may need in 
the professional world but I may make 
some connections in their personal world 
the better I get to know them I love 
that now 
a scenario keeps popping into my mind so 
I'm gonna I'm gonna ask your opinion on 
this as the NCG Guru as well as 
a man if a woman is on a date with the 
man who seems like maybe he's not but in 
this conversation he seems like he's a 
taker because she's asking the questions 
and he is probably nervous and he's just 
trying to impress her so he's talk talk 
talk Talking how does she 
respectfully get him 
to ask her some questions and so I'll 
tell my clients just say oh my goodness 
that's so interesting Larry that reminds 
me of a time where I blah blah blah and 
sometimes they'll say I did that and 
then he brought it right back to himself 
again so is there a way to put these 
conversations back on track or what's 
your experience around this 
so I'll tell you and it's it is 
interesting and some people are 
takers have to be open that that maybe 
they're not truly takers like you said 
me if they're nervous or someone has to 
show them the pathway I will tell you 
I've had some direct conversations some 
people are takers and you're not going 
to convert them 
and so it's it's kind of that red flag 
and so at times I've I've said you know 
Bella 
you're really interesting I've learned 
to help a lot today thanks for all that 
sharing 
I 
but I I was curious you you don't seem 
to know a lot about me 
and I was wondering if you'd like to 
know more about me 
and you know because 
it's it's a way of bringing it back now 
at that point if you go oh no Larry 
we're all good 
I'm glad you learned a lot about me 
because I'm much more interesting than 
you you know we're good 
I think it's a good test to see do they 
bring it oh my God I'm so sorry I'm so 
nervous 
and maybe that will turn things around 
or you're gonna find out 
this is probably a bad connection this 
person just is about themselves big ego 
you know just not not probably the right 
match and so I think in business and in 
your personal life 
there's nothing wrong with kind of 
calling them out in a nice way hey some 
great stuff I learned about you today I 
was curious would you like to know 
anything about me because I think I'm 
pretty interesting too you could kind of 
make it like a joke right you can make 
it a little light-hearted yeah I really 
love how you've framed that and it's 
positive it's not antagonistic it 
doesn't come from a place of defense and 
it still comes from a place of social 
generosity right like God Larry I've 
enjoyed all of this I I know so much 
about you for you know how you created 
the NCG method until you know what you 
hope your grandkids are named you know 
are you know I'd love to tell you more 
about me is that of interest to you 
that's such a great way to re and it and 
it might be embarrassing for the person 
but I think they'll also really 
appreciate your grace 
you'll know who they are and I did do 
that with the gentleman on the East 
Coast I call them out very nicely 
I said hey you know you really shared a 
lot with me today I really learned a lot 
very impressive how you made a career 
shift if I say what he did everyone 
would you know you'd probably know where 
people know him so I'm not going to do 
that and so I kind of called them out 
and I said you know honestly 
you really today you know you don't know 
a lot about me I know a lot about you 
but you don't know if I'm married if I 
have kids and even what I do for a 
living 
and he said you know you're right 
and that was about it he didn't go down 
the path didn't ask 
and it was it was really kind of awkward 
and I could tell 
he wasn't going there and then he did a 
follow-up email 
requesting some introductions and and 
not even a 
you know I I reflected on our 
conversation thanks for sharing that I'm 
so sorry I'd love to learn more 
and I just knew taker 
and you can't get him there he wasn't 
getting it and I'm sure a lot of folks 
on dates 
have met that person 
and there's nothing wrong with calling 
it out because maybe they're nervous or 
you're going to flush out that they 
really are 
that take are self-centered 
and you're just not going to get them to 
to move to your direction and there's 
nothing wrong with it find it out early 
rather than than later unless you like 
that type of person I don't oh I don't 
like that I don't like my clients dating 
that kind of person because that's what 
they've usually come from right givers 
have a magnetic force in the dating 
world to take hers right and it is a 
very dysfunctional dance so I want to 
give her to be with the giver and so 
unfortunately a lot of my clients that 
are givers you know who you are or my 
listeners they sometimes we don't even 
know what a taker looks like because 
that's all we've known 
that's good and that's what we do it's 
like I think that's a taker but I love 
the script I love calling people out on 
it in a gentle way which becomes a fork 
in the road test how is that person 
going to react are they going to say oh 
my gosh silly me I would love to learn 
more about you thank you for bringing 
that up right that's a person that we 
can give a hall pass to but if it's the 
person like you just talked to the 
person where you told the guy and the 
dude just looked at you and was like 
yeah and and then had the 
audacity to not ask you not schedule a 
follow-up conversation like wow I would 
really love this to be the Larry show 
this time and hear from you and by the 
way could you connect me to these five 
people are you kidding right that's your 
litmus test right people show us who 
they are it's up to us to believe them 
yeah it's it's uh it's scary I was 
meeting with a gentleman years ago and I 
I was having a heart issue 
and I was and I could feel I was going 
into AFib 
my heart was just beating very fast and 
I knew I know when I go into this and I 
told the gentleman who was showing up 
and throwing up and he interrupted him 
said hey 
just so you know right now I can feel it 
I'm an afib I'm gonna probably need to 
go to the hospital 
do you do you want to continue the 
meeting you know or you would you like 
me to leave and go to the hospital so if 
you're okay with it we can continue 
he did he did so I I continued because 
I've been through this before 
but I never talked to him again because 
so I just I said okay I'll finish this 
meeting with him it was another 15-20 
minutes and but if it was the tables 
returned I would say oh my God can I 
arrive into the hospital yeah exactly I 
did go to the hospital after 
I made it I'm okay 
but you know that's that's the extreme 
but there are people like that out there 
that just want to hear themselves 
and don't want to learn about the other 
person and it continually happens 
in the business world when I'm just in a 
general business meeting with people in 
career transition 
and and probably people who are single 
you know or divorced or and you know 
challenged and but I think if someone 
kind of redirects that conversation 
the people that are coachable are going 
to come around 
yeah and they may just not be aware of 
it and they may just know gosh I never 
get the second and the third date right 
now somebody you know what brave enough 
has said to you hey you know what I know 
a lot about you would you like to know 
about me 
and it's very different than saying you 
haven't asked me any questions you don't 
know anything about me right it's I love 
how you how you've said that I think 
that that's a really really great and 
powerful nicer way 
absolutely and it's what we call being 
socially generous how do you put more 
love into the world how do you show up 
in a better way and you know on dates 
well we're always telling our clients 
look for what's good look for three 
things that you liked about this person 
even if it wasn't a love connection 
because when you head into this date 
this connection with the Positive 
mindset if you know Bella or Lindsay or 
Eileen your dating coaches are going to 
say tell me three things that you liked 
about this person you automatically go 
into what's good about this person so it 
turns that maybe defensive posture into 
well I've got to report back to my 
dating coaches about three things I 
liked about this person's so it just 
puts people into a positive mindset and 
I think that your NCG factor is talking 
about that so if we look at this you 
know from a dating or a business 
standpoint n is networking C is 
connecting G is growing so how giving 
giving sorry growing giving giving is 
growing it is good recovery 
exactly so we want to give right and 
that's the thing so we go into our 
interactions positively looking for 
what's good listening and having the 
intention to give right and that give 
doesn't mean you're going to go home 
with somebody so don't misinterpret me 
if the ask is hey do you want to do you 
want to come up to my place the answer 
could be no but how about we have 
another date next Tuesday 
there you go right so 
um and the connecting you know just to 
kind of loop it back is asking the right 
questions and being genuinely interested 
in this person now you and I talked a 
little bit about this as we were 
prepping for this so one of the big 
complaints you know I should let me let 
me let me reframe this positively most 
people's ideal way of meeting their 
potential mate is through a common 
connection or organically and they'll 
complain all the time no one sets me up 
on dates nobody they're all like oh 
you're amazing if you were single I'd be 
like oh Larry you're amazing I don't 
know anybody as amazing as you are and 
then they go about their merry way do 
you have any tips for 
singles that want to 
look at their networks and connect with 
people to connect and give but also the 
get for them could be getting set up on 
dates like tell us about this 
well you know the question I would have 
for your your single audience would be 
how many folks in your single audience 
are meeting with people they know are 
connectors 
right right some people put it on their 
LinkedIn profile their Facebook other 
profiles and social media so if you know 
they're a connector already 
they could be a good person to know now 
they may be a connector more in business 
but you know I I learn about people in 
in my meetings 
and I like I said I get to know them 
personally and professionally so so our 
tell me about your family do you have a 
you know a family you know well I have a 
mom and a dad no no no no no more direct 
are you in a relationship do you have 
kids oh no I I'm single or I'm divorced 
great or are you you know close to 
getting remarried are you on the the 
dating circuit how's that going post 
covet and oh yeah I'm having a lot of 
trouble well what what's uh what's your 
profile what do you look for it's like 
what I'm like hey look I'm a connector 
I put people together you know make 
business connections but also personal 
I've gotten a couple married and you 
know put people together fall in love or 
if people just want something more 
casual I've done it all right so what 
are you looking for and so I get their 
profile and what do you like you tell me 
about height age range you know do they 
have to be in the city you know because 
you're in the city or you'll deal with a 
Suburban person or you want it out of 
state or out of country even better 
right so I will get some of those specs 
and I'll think about my network and it's 
funny like I've tried to put some people 
together and they get they get busy or 
kovid's gotten in the way oh yeah we're 
going to connect and I caught covet and 
so I gotta reconnect them it's like well 
I got dysfunctional people I'm trying to 
connect that want a date and just can't 
get together or they really don't want 
to date and that's a whole nother they 
don't but your single population they 
need to be more open when meeting with 
people so because you know we say oh you 
get a significant other you know I'm I'm 
dating you know I'm having trouble 
finding the right person yeah I notice 
you're a connector Larry so just keep 
that in mind but don't be so timid 
ask hey do you do you know anyone could 
you help me if I gave you sort of what 
I'm looking for yeah I love connecting 
people but I ask some people don't 
go to the lengths that I do but your 
single audience if they don't share it 
they'll never know but if they start 
opening up and dropping those hints but 
they know that person they're meeting 
with is a connector 
uh they may be successful in getting 
connected 
you know in that way 
no that's so true and for the record 
tell us about your LinkedIn prowess how 
many LinkedIn connections do you have 
it's like Off the Grid 
well I have uh I have just under 30 000. 
30 000 LinkedIn connections you guys 
that's like a small suburb okay so this 
guy's walking us walk he's talking his 
talk and accepts LinkedIn so I'm sure 
you'll get a lot of LinkedIn requests 
from listeners from this podcast and I'm 
sure you'll accept any and all 
connections as you always do if they 
reference Bella oh so y'all reference me 
and say I listen to the podcast Larry 
and I'm single and I'm looking for a 
blah blah blah just kidding and then 
remember when if you do Link in with him 
get to know him what do you have to give 
as well right this is not just to get 
you want to be a giver as well so so but 
what Larry's saying is something Lindsay 
Eileen and I talk to our clients about 
when they get you know uh I don't want 
to online data anymore it's like okay 
let's look through your networks let's 
make a list of everybody that you've 
known and I have done this with people 
make a list of every person that you 
know from the time from you the time you 
were in elementary school middle school 
high school college grad school first 
job second job third job 
all the people that are in your network 
and you know for some people that might 
be 50 people for some people they might 
be able to delineate 500 people right 
it's like okay now what do I do well 
look for the people in that that love to 
connect people they're those people 
maybe they're on a lot of boards they 
just love putting people together and we 
all know who those people in our 
networks are and we call them super 
connectors who are the super connectors 
in your network and do that shake out of 
your network right and we've had people 
fill out charts like who are those 
people and then 
put that put together what I call a 
personal board of directors 
and let's say I was a single person and 
I said okay I'm looking at all my people 
and I'd say wow Larry Kaufman would 
definitely be considered a super 
connector so I might call you up and say 
Larry can we can I take you to lunch 
and you'd say sure okay so we'd go to 
lunch and I'd say listen I've I'm 
killing it in my professional life but I 
really want to focus on my personal life 
and I've gone through my network and I 
want you to know that you're one of the 
people that I respect most you're always 
so giving and you connect people and I 
would like to nominate you to be on Team 
Bella so you get to officially like keep 
me in mind if you think you'd find any 
eligible single guys that would be good 
for me and so connecting with you has 
now said wow and I tell my clients do it 
in this way find your people and then 
tell them why they're amazing and why 
you're putting them on your personal 
board of directors everybody wants to be 
chosen and nominated for something so 
they've had the ones that have deployed 
this have had success doing it and if 
not it's just fun because you get to 
reconnect with connections and you don't 
know where those connections could take 
you 
so I I love I love that approach I like 
what you're doing and I can equate it to 
people in transition and in my book I 
talk about inner circle and outer 
circles so we're Inner Circle and you 
know in our inner circles I'm sure you 
and I have like a massive inner circle 
of people we know like and Trust they 
would probably do almost anything for us 
and that's kind of what you said and 
some of those are super connectors are 
just great people that love you and then 
there's that next layer and so what 
we're in transition we reach out to the 
Inner Circle 
and you lay out that profile here's what 
I'm looking for I'll add another piece 
to what you're talking about because 
you're asking 
but are you giving too so I always say 
including that messaging hey you're 
great I want you to be on Team Bella 
but I also want to you know reconnect 
have lunch learn what's going on in your 
world how I could be helpful to you 
and by the way you know we need favors 
and I talk about you know needing a 
favor and so this is a favor so we're in 
transition we go okay here's the types 
of companies Industries blah blah blah 
the types of role 
here's the types of men or women or 
whatever here's I'm looking for I'm back 
in the dating circuit and I want to go 
out with someone that you recommend you 
know you know a lot of people if anyone 
comes across anyone like this 
is what I'm looking for and so you could 
almost take the career transition 
messaging 
into the dating messaging too 
absolutely and and I'll put one caveat 
or one addition onto this amazing 
messaging that Larry's giving us and how 
to how to modify that and you can have 
your ask but then also have your give in 
there now and I've seen this happen 
where 
someone will get a setup from another 
person let's say Larry you're like Bella 
I had a guy for you I think you'll like 
him he lives in the city your husband 
will like him my husband will like him 
and he'll be fine if I go out on a 
couple dates with him he's fine he's 
super flexible just kidding so I'm just 
using myself as the example here 
um and let's say the date let's say 
Larry sets me up on a date and this guy 
could be a great friend to Larry he 
could be a great resource to Larry but 
in the Romantic world he might be kind 
of a mess but there's no way for Larry 
to have known that right and those kinds 
of things happen 
and even what I tell our clients is when 
someone sets you up on a date even if 
it's the worst date you've ever been on 
send the person a thank you note like 
thank you for thinking of me I really 
appreciate it that person that set you 
up even if it's the worst date you've 
ever been on they did it from a place of 
love and they didn't know you don't have 
to say it was the best date I've ever 
been on and you just want to acknowledge 
the fact that that person did you a 
favor and you never know maybe they'll 
keep their eyes open if they ask you how 
did the date go you can be judicious in 
the feedback that you give because you 
don't want them to say I'm never setting 
anybody up again I know the guy that 
owns the salon I get my hair cut at he's 
so funny he's like I don't know how you 
do what you do for work Bella because 
one day I tried to set up two of my 
clients and I thought they would really 
hit it off and he was really successful 
and she was really successful and they 
seemed like they would hit it off and 
they had such a terrible date that they 
both called me spewing then them and 
he's like never again will I set two 
people up 
I'm like don't do that like those are 
just two people but you meet so many 
people don't let that sour you those two 
people shouldn't have done what they did 
bad on them but good on you for having 
done it 
all right that's great advice and you 
know you it can't always be perfect I 
know I put together two folks he liked 
the woman 
the woman said he was nice good looking 
smart successful he was too short 
and he was taller than she was 
but she really wanted him a little 
taller but I couldn't couldn't fix that 
if he was a little taller they would 
then I did find her a former Top Gun 
literally Tom Cruise 
and and they they got along they went 
out for a while and then moved on you 
know but that was successful but he was 
taller so but I got feedback so okay no 
worries what's the height 
so I got better at asking about Heights 
I did meet a a woman and it was 
interesting when she gave me descriptors 
what she wanted so what do you what do 
you want you know in a a guy that you'd 
like to go out with so I want them to be 
you know over six foot 
um 250 
to like an income 
no and wait 
what do you mean she said well 
my my ex had a six pack 
I want someone self-conscious so they 
got a little little girth to them she's 
looking for a dad bud probably yeah she 
didn't quite freeze it but yeah probably 
like a stocky tough but with a little 
something to hold on to that was 
interesting so you know it's it's 
interesting but I've gotten better so I 
can do a better job 
well look at this you guys he's also 
matchmaking so now you have a real 
reason to to connect with the esteemed 
Larry Kaufman so 
um well for I want you to tell us two 
stories you said you told me that you 
helped a CEO not only 
that was in transition but you also 
helped him to find love so tell us about 
that 
so yeah so I I met a CEO that was in 
transition 
and I said you know I met him at a 
coffee shop I was with someone else 
we should get together separately which 
we did and we had a great meeting and I 
didn't know of any CEO jobs for him but 
I kept it in the back of my mind and a 
couple weeks later I met a founder of 
100 million dollar company that had a 
business issue and I thought this this 
guy that I just met could really help 
him with that issue put the guys 
together lo and behold 
that 100 million dollar founder hired 
this CEO as president of his company 
which grew to 200 million and there was 
an exit and my guy was back in 
transition in the midst of that 
he went through a divorce 
and we became very good friends and you 
know he became a client friend Etc well 
now he's gone through a divorce so I 
feel I got to help him in this time of 
need to connect with someone of the 
opposite sex and I had met an HR 
executive who was in transition so CEO 
and HR those are good people to network 
with when they're in transition but I 
have intuition and I thought both of 
them would get along personally 
and so I told each of them they need to 
get together to network but I told each 
of them I think there's something Beyond 
business between the two of you so they 
each knew that going into it and I found 
out he was he didn't want to tell me but 
took him like a year to tell me that 
they had fallen in love 
so I did a good job so got him a job 
found him 
someone that he fell in love with and 
that was good so it's only by asking and 
building these deep relationships so he 
definitely likes me a lot 
no I love that 
um of course you found him work you 
found him a an exit and you found a true 
love like you he's he should have a 
statue of you bronzed in front of his 
house he actually does he does oh my 
gosh well we'll have to put that in the 
show notes if you have a photo of that 
we'll link it so next year next year 
cute headshot so 
um well tell us about how you met your 
wife this is a great story you shared 
this with me the very first time that we 
spoke I I I did so uh this year 
2000 because you never know where we're 
at but 2022 I celebrated 33 years of 
marriage and 
so I met my wife 
about 34 plus years ago and we met 
through a McDonald's drive-through now I 
will tell you I was in the midst back 
then in the 80s signing up with a dating 
service Bella I don't know if you 
remember that but I was going to sign up 
for a dating service back then and we 
didn't have I don't think we had 
computers back then or the internet like 
the internet wasn't in existence yeah it 
was very manual but I was about to sign 
on the dotted line 
and I met my wife through the 
drive-through and she was a manager so 
she actually wasn't at the window 
and so I will tell you I went through 
the one time and got my food and I saw 
her 
it's hard to see her but you know she's 
a woman in a uniform with glasses and I 
don't know if it was the burgundy you 
know polyester 
I don't know what it was there so I left 
decided I would come back again I came 
back one more time my food was not ready 
and so they told me to park and this 
McDonald's was by the first original 
McDonald's in Des Plaines Illinois so it 
was the museum and this is the 
functioning I would waited for my food I 
wrote down my home number on a business 
card 
and I waited hoping it was to be this 
woman that would come out bring me my 
food 
it was her 
she did tell me that as a manager she 
would never go out and bring out food 
and they were so busy wouldn't have 
known it was me out there she came out I 
had my car took my food gave her my card 
and that was it and all I'll tell you is 
I never came back again 
in about seven weeks later I got a call 
at home 
and it was this woman I never knew her 
name 
and next thing you know is we ended up 
going out there's more of the story but 
we ended up going out 
there was a big age difference of about 
five years so she was very young we 
ended up getting married we elope to 
Vegas about a year later got married at 
the chapel of love and she was only 19 
when we got married and we celebrated 33 
years this year so she's uh she's a good 
human being and my inspiration for the 
book and uh you know she's been a life 
changer for me 
oh that's amazing and tell you know 
you've shared so many great things you 
know I think 
how to be a better dater right do you 
have any 
I think you've given us so many things 
about being a great listener being 
genuinely interested in somebody right 
being a giver how can you give back on a 
date so even if it's not a love 
connection if this person maybe said 
that they were interested in you know in 
magic tricks and if you know somebody in 
your network that is a magician or you 
find something at some point that's on a 
Blog you can send it to this person and 
say hey this made me think of you 
what do you think of that no I agree and 
that's why you know you you ask good 
questions and right it may not be a love 
connection but you heard something or 
your child was looking for an internship 
and a lot of us think like even with the 
magician example do we have a magician 
in our Network probably not but somebody 
we know probably knows somebody yeah you 
don't know until you go to your network 
and put it out there and ask it's like 
oh so if you're connected to Bellas and 
Larry's and Megan wessels 
you'll have access to people they know 
so somewhere they're going to know 
somebody 
and that's where it comes back so don't 
always assume it's who you know directly 
it's it's actually that next level that 
that next level second degree that your 
network knows someone that could help 
that person on that bad date like it was 
really a bad date in their true taker 
don't feel guilty you didn't you don't 
have to get something out you don't have 
to give you don't have to give you know 
it reminds me of something that we tell 
our female clients a lot is you know 
they'll say Okay I want to get out of my 
zone and I want to meet people in an 
organic environment and let's say 
they'll go to a wine tasting event okay 
and they'll sign up for some meetup 
group and I will always tell them listen 
in general women tend to be more 
comfortable showing up at singles events 
than single guys are if they don't have 
a buddy to show up with so expect 
everything set expectations where it's 
going to be 80 percent women maybe 10 to 
20 percent guys but when you walk in 
there I don't want you to roll your eyes 
and say oh my God this is a bust I want 
you to walk around the room and meet 
five to ten women that maybe aren't in 
your age bracket but women every woman 
in that room is connected to men that 
she wouldn't or couldn't date maybe it's 
a brother maybe it's a cousin maybe it's 
her boss you never know and if you walk 
in with good intentions and you're 
socially generous and you're a good 
listener and you're likable and you're 
interesting she'll probably say well who 
are you looking for oh my gosh you know 
what you should go on on a date with my 
brother this actually happened to a 
client of mine in New York city so I 
gave her this advice she was going to a 
house party I said just be willing to 
talk to people and be you and be 
genuinely interested in them she starts 
talking to a woman so my client was 
named Jill she meets a woman named Sarah 
at this party and she says and her and 
Sarah are talking and Jill's a therapist 
and somehow it comes up in conversation 
that she's single and she says but I've 
just hired this dating coach in Chicago 
and it's fantastic and her name is Bella 
and she's doing this thing with Smart 
dating Academy and so this girl Sarah 
says 
a dating coach does that even exist oh 
my gosh I'm super fascinated in this 
career could you connect me with your 
dating coach fella and she said oh 
absolutely Bella would totally talk to 
you about what it's like to do this and 
she said and Jill did such a good job in 
this conversation Sarah said you know 
what my brother's an attorney but he 
also does stand up on the weekends I 
think you should I I kind of think you 
guys would like each other and so she 
got a date out of it as well 
wow 
and did you talk to that woman about 
being a dating coach she became a dating 
coach for a couple of years and she had 
been an executive recruiter but she has 
three small kids and the demands of date 
coaching are higher than one might think 
from an hours just from uh from uh what 
do you need to do standpoint so I don't 
think that it ended up being the right 
career for her but she loved it for the 
time that she did it 
that's awesome well I think your advice 
to folks who are single the things you 
shared are spot on they're fantastic and 
they line up nicely with things that you 
know I would consider doing and I like I 
like the fact that you go to some event 
and it's you think there would be more 
men in talking to folks because you just 
never know and you're right and some 
some may have gone on the a date that 
they just weren't compatible or maybe 
that shorter guy 
well maybe there's a woman goes I like 
short men 
yeah well he was great let me connect 
you so you never know 
you never know and let me ask you this 
question if you could how do if we're 
listening to this and going okay am I a 
giver or am I a taker are there any red 
flags that we might be takers 
well I I think the the red flags are 
yeah so you some have read my book and 
said oh my God I'm a taker 
and it may be that you know they see the 
show up and throw up that they're really 
not getting to know people 
and and I some people really don't do it 
intentionally and you know I had a CEO 
over uh three billion in Revenue at a 
big company and she couldn't wait to 
call me and say Larry I was in a meeting 
and I never would have done this but I 
was actively listening and I told 
someone in the meeting hey I should 
connect you to so and so and she was so 
excited because she never thought that 
way so it's it's a different way to 
think 
and behave when you meet with people and 
to be more focused on that other person 
and so I don't think it's that 
everyone's a taker but as you as you 
start thinking about when you're in 
meetings depending on what you do and it 
could just be when you're at a party or 
with neighbors 
are you talking all about how great you 
are and I did this and I did that versus 
hey tell me what's going on in your 
world and you know how's covet impacted 
you announce tell me about your family 
what's going on here with you 
your family and amazing as you start to 
ask and listen 
but that's how you figure out how you 
would take or it's just it's I always 
tell people you guys self-reflect just 
the hearing the things we talked about 
today 
some people are probably self-reflecting 
going oh oh my God 
I think I'm a bit of a taker I think I 
gotta change my way so if we hit some 
people today they're going to shift and 
change 
then that was a big win job well done so 
dear listener I'm going to put a link to 
the NCG Factor book in the show notes so 
make sure if this conversation resonated 
with you that you buy Larry's book it's 
a great read you can probably read it in 
an afternoon and I think it'll be a book 
that you'll want to read again and again 
and pass on to your network as part of 
being a giver so Larry thank you so much 
for giving us of yourself for giving 
your time to our listener and I think 
that this was 
um such a great conversation and I'm 
really inspired so thank you I loved it 
thank you for all that you do for people 
today you're wonderful and thanks for 
having me today
