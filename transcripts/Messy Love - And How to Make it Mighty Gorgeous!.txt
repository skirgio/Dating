badass wow hey oh wow 
badass that 
that that is me tell us 
um 
a little book about messy love let's 
start there what inspired you to write 
this tell us a little bit about messy 
love 
oh I think messing Love is Everything I 
think it's marriage I think it's dating 
I think it's breaking up I think it's 
tossing crap in the corner I think it's 
friendship I think it's everything I 
think everything is about a relationship 
everything 
everything is relation is is 
the foundation of you know relationships 
right 
messy love is about my marriage to can 
messy love is about finding myself messy 
love is about 
dropping out of high school 
and you know kind of rebelling 
messy love is about my own 
finding my own heart 
oh my God amazing and you guys I was so 
lucky to get an advanced reader copy of 
this amazing book and I literally sent 
Amy a note this morning when I finished 
it like oh my God I have so many 
thoughts I have so many feelings I need 
to go for a really long run to process 
this I'm in love with you I'm in love 
with this book and I just you guys I 
I've never done this but I'm so 
compelled by the intro I I think I want 
to begin by taking a couple of minutes I 
want you to hear 
Amy's voice in my voice and I'm going to 
read you the intro okay about up to 
messy look 
in 67 years I've had my heart ripped to 
shreds broken into pieces and crazy 
glued back together I dropped out of 
high school tried suicide and spent some 
time on a commune I was thrown out for 
shaving my legs true story 
I got my GED at 17 and never went on to 
college I filled my body with enough 
drugs to open a pharmacy and I slept 
with the gazillion wrong men whose first 
name was either Joe or David or I'll 
call you 
I fell down I got up I fell down I got 
up I fell down I got up I spent all the 
money I made as a waitress and temp 
worker on fast food and useless direct 
and then I started making a ton of dough 
as a writer I wrote a couple of groovy 
movies that got made into groovy films 
and have had more than a few books 
published I have loved bad men and cruel 
men and married the coolest guy on the 
[ __ ] planet 
I've been betrayed and hurt and cracked 
wide open by women friends and you'll 
still get me to love you and Champion 
you and toss you a line 
I lost my mom to dementia and I lost my 
dad to a heart attack and my family 
unraveled into a million as strange 
threads 
I don't believe in God but I do believe 
we are all capable of being God or 
goddess-like kind good loving and 
compassionate and I do believe if there 
is a God it is a woman 
I think Colin Kaepernick is a superhero 
and men who abuse their power are 
insecure and small little [ __ ] up 
slimy creeps I believe in second chances 
and I believe that the third time is in 
fact a charm 
I believe there's nothing more glorious 
than a human who can stand in their own 
power and be comfortable in their own 
skin and own their beauty and their 
greatness I can safely say that yes I 
have made it to that place 
I believe getting loved is way better 
way better than getting laid but getting 
laid beats phone sex by a good mile but 
nothing beats self-love nothing 
I know for a fact that kind is way 
better than nice and that the Verizon 
friends and family plants pretty bogus 
I recommend we put a fast halt on being 
needed and pump the [ __ ] gas on 
being wanted oof take that one I feel 
strongly about inequality and Injustice 
and that poverty destroys and kills more 
lives than we care to admit I know for a 
fact that depression comes in waves and 
tsunamis and dementia grabs you by the 
throat and doesn't let you go 
I know that money doesn't buy you 
happiness or friendship or love but 
having some cast sure the [ __ ] makes you 
less worried 
I learned a long time ago that marrying 
well can't hold a candle to marrying 
good and if you can't find a light at 
the end of the tunnel you are in the 
wrong [ __ ] tunnel there is always a 
light somewhere I love that my life is 
made up of broken edgy frayed 
magnificent glorious sexy gooey messy 
Amazing Life pieces I am so proud of who 
I have become because I gotta say for a 
while it's touch and [ __ ] go I'm 
absolutely thrilled to be here I mean 
you guys this is just the intro Amy Amy 
just 
I'm gonna turn the mic over to you talk 
to us tell us about your growing up 
oh my God first of all can I just say 
hearing you read that 
made me so proud of me 
I don't know if I can actually even talk 
right now I've never heard anybody read 
it out loud 
it's amazing so I just have to thank you 
for giving me the opportunity to hear 
about me 
and 
how proud I am of me 
it really I and I genuinely 
wholeheartedly mean this it's 
it's astonishing to hear somebody read 
your life 
with such passion and authenticity and 
Authority 
and I think and I'm I'm pretty sure that 
what you just did is you just kind of 
cracked open my heart 
from my own life so thank you and I mean 
that thank you 
you're welcome you're welcome you are I 
have had lots of people with lots of 
books on this show and that intro just 
gripped me because it's it's Fierce it's 
real it's authentic and I love that you 
wrote This Book 
as a lesson to your younger self and 
and lessons to all of us and that's why 
I just couldn't be more honored and 
happy to have you here to talk to us 
about the fact that you didn't just get 
placed up on this pedestal 
you had a long winding messy road to get 
to where you are now and in retrospect 
you can tell all of us you can tell 
little Amy and little Bella and all of 
us out there you know what I believe in 
you and you're beautiful just the way 
you are so tell us a little bit about 
you're growing up I mean that's pretty 
awesome you know I grew up out on Long 
Island you know in the suburbs and 
there was always a feeling of I didn't 
belong and it wasn't it wasn't that I 
didn't feel like I didn't belong 
in the typical way that people say oh I 
don't belong 
it you know my family was very messy my 
dad had been arrested when I was a 
little girl 
you know 
um that was very traumatic but he became 
my hero and he taught me about love in a 
way that both my mother and father you 
know I there's a piece in the book where 
you know my mom pawned all of her 
jewelry to to you know throw him a 50th 
birthday party 
to buy him a pinky ring buy him a pinky 
ring and it was wrapped up 
in a beautiful package and you know and 
I so 
you know it's funny because my and this 
is something this is the truth my mother 
was not a very good mother 
my mother didn't know how to nurture my 
mother was the youngest of five I think 
so she was the baby and so she was 
always taken care of and she was always 
nurtured right 
and my dad just loved her I mean the 
moment he saw her in a two-piece bathing 
suit somewhere it was like I'm gonna 
marry that woman 
and they had a phenomenal love affair 
so I learned how to love 
through their love 
I learned how to be a woman of great 
forgiveness because I watched my father 
go through hell 
and my mother stayed with him and stood 
by him she never belittled him and any 
person who mistreated him during that 
time she was like no they're not coming 
back in our lives 
you know she was 
she loved him and he loved her so I 
learned love 
in in a way that I probably wouldn't you 
know I learned it from them I didn't 
learn love from being loved by her 
but I learned Love by watching them 
and so there in in and of itself is like 
a kind of a wacky kind of thing right I 
wasn't nurtured I wasn't you know I 
wasn't really taking care of as a little 
girl but 
I grew up to be very appreciative of 
what they had 
and I think their love is why I love my 
husband the way I do 
you know there's a lot of [ __ ] up 
stuff in between but I think 
um so I grew up out on Long Island you 
know 
um very kind of unstable for a while we 
lived you know in the suburbs 
um I still have I still my friend Ellen 
Klein who lived across the street you 
know I love her with everything in me 
she's still you know I she's like still 
that girl you know 
um and she did she lived across the 
street on Marion Drive 
um 
and 
and at 15 or whatever I dropped out of 
high school 
and I went to go live on a commune with 
a boy who did not love me and told you 
as much like um you know he said I don't 
love you that way and I thought well you 
know he doesn't have to love me that way 
but let me get out of here but I did so 
I left I left home and you know lived on 
a commune and for a very short short 
period of time because Jewish girls 
don't go to live in communes 
they go to Fortune Ops or or backs or 
you know or a mall I mean go to a mall 
for a year 
hang out at Baker's Shoes don't go to 
but 
I never 
knew the value of my own life 
and and when my dad took me to the 
airport to so I can get on a plane to be 
with a boy that didn't want me or loved 
me my father said to me 
I can't make your mistakes for you 
oh wow now here I am he drives me from 
Long Island to I forget what the airport 
was it wasn't LaGuardia it was something 
else 
um or it wasn't Kennedy or maybe it was 
um 
and he 
I was his little girl 
he was putting me on a plane to make a 
gigantic mistake 
you know 
um 
and him saying I can't make your 
mistakes for you was the greatest piece 
of advice and lesson 
because my father had a a an incredible 
belief in me 
and B he himself had 
had you know a for lack of a better word 
you know a rebirth you know he he had 
another chance he was given a second 
chance 
and I think that's partially where I get 
my passion for people who 
you know 
deserves second and third chances 
because I watched my father you know go 
from being a very big man to being a 
very small man 
to picking himself up 
and making something of his life and his 
for his his family 
and 
he was my hero you know he was the guy 
who 
showed me that second and third chances 
are you know what we sit in a movie 
theater rooting for right 
we're in a dark movie theater and we're 
sitting there and we're watching you 
know people falling down and we're 
watching them scraping and getting by 
and people hissing and saying [ __ ] you 
and get out of here and then at the end 
when they redeem themselves right 
we're in a dark theater and we're 
rooting for them 
and we don't do that often in real life 
but in a dark movie theater we do 
we want that guy to become a hero we 
want that woman to become a Shiro we 
want that that little girl to pick 
herself up and you know basically say 
you can't bully me anymore you know and 
so for me 
that's probably one of my greatest 
Passions 
is turning mistakes into mission 
and to be always that woman sitting in a 
dark movie theater rooting for the 
underdog rooting for the person who's 
lost everything rooting for someone 
who's made mistakes someone who's 
getting out of prison you know and 
trying to get back in life and you know 
or 
whereas somebody who deserves another 
chance at this thing called life 
so I'm going to be in a dark movie 
theater rooting them on and I'm going to 
be out in the sunlight rooting them up 
and 
you know and that's really how I feel 
you know I didn't grow up you know I I I 
didn't 
when people say oh I'm gonna I'm Gonna 
Leave to find myself I didn't find 
myself 
if it wasn't leaving to find myself I 
was leaving to hide from myself 
yeah you know 
and what I what I 
was so drawn to and attached to is what 
you talk about the differences between 
nice and kind and people pleasing and 
not being included and how and so I 
think I can relate I think every human 
on earth has been left out not invited 
to the bowling party not invited to the 
birthday party and how those things and 
what what I found so fascinating is you 
grew up in a home and you had the these 
parents that were mutually you know 
mutually obsessed with each other a 
mutual admiration society and you were 
sort of a spectator to that and always 
wanted to be included and weren't always 
included and at 15 here's someone who 
said well I'll include you kind of and 
you're like oh [ __ ] let's go I guess we 
kissed in the back a car and all of a 
sudden it was like I'm going with this 
guy I don't care who he is 
he's willing to bring me even though 
he's not in love with me in that way 
that's fine I'll take the leap it was 
like the ultimate birthday party that 
you just got invited to 
you know I think that being included or 
being excluded and all of that I think 
that that's something that we women 
you know feel viscerally 
you know it's like if somebody's 
throwing a dinner 
and all of a sudden you find out that 
you're not on the dinner list you know I 
don't care how old we are I don't care 
how many times we say we don't care 
it triggers so much you know not being 
included not feeling wanted 
um 
it triggers those pieces in US 
where we're back being that young girl 
or that little girl or not getting 
invited to the bowling party or oh my 
God they're going to Carvel and I'm not 
going to get sprinkles on my ice cream 
cone because they're not you know 
we 
all we really want as human beings 
bottom line is to be loved 
yeah 
that's all we want 
and how we seek it is how you know 
whatever we do right you know some 
people like think okay I'm gonna become 
the greatest person you know I'm going 
to become a goat and I'm going to become 
the greatest at something and everyone 
will love me but everything we do 
everything is because we want to be 
loved 
and the Hoops we go through 
and 
the crazy stuff we do and the mistakes 
we make and the mistakes we sleep with 
and the mistakes we marry and the 
mistakes you know it's 
it all comes down to wanting to be loved 
100 and and in its simplest form to your 
point it's being included being invited 
right what does love mean right to so 
many of us and and and if you think 
about it 
public speaking they say is the number 
one fear of most humans and if you think 
about it why would that be a bigger fear 
than death right but if you play it out 
to its extreme it gets to your point if 
I get on stage and if I make a total ass 
and a debacle of myself and I have a 
panic attack and I can't get the words 
out then people will think I'm a failure 
people will think I'm a loser and 
everybody will abandon me and they'll 
jump ship and ultimately it's fear of 
rejection absolutely that that's it 
bingo 
and and you know how many people fear 
that everybody everybody you know and if 
people don't tell you that you know if 
people say oh that that isn't you know 
my thing or I'm not worried about being 
abandoned or you know I overcame that 
you know no 
those are things that 
you know come back 
in different shapes and forms and 
you know 
a hundred years ago uh you know somebody 
said to me what is your greatest fear 
right and I was and seriously this was 
pre-ken 
and 
you know I listed like 12 things 
and and he said no no it's only one 
it's only one thing and all those other 
things 
are born out of that one thing and I 
remembered thinking what and I went in 
and I really kind of struggled with what 
is it that I'm afraid of why is it that 
I'm afraid to get close to you know 
somebody why is it that I choose men who 
you know I have to try to make happy 
and I realized you know after like doing 
this incredible dive inward 
that I was afraid of abandonment 
and and I could pinpoint why I was 
afraid of it 
and where it was born 
and why every time I I was in a 
situation where I thought oh my God I'm 
going to be you know 
I'm going to be left or you know 
you know I envisioned this little girl 
you know sitting with her voice at her 
grandmother's waiting for her mother to 
come back for her 
you know because I would my mom would 
take me to Brooklyn every kind of almost 
every weekend and I would hang with my 
grandparents 
who were Yiddish and didn't speak a word 
you know it was like I was Amy 
[Laughter] 
and I came home and it was like no my 
name is Amy it's not me 
pay me 
um and 
you know and I also learned love from my 
grandparents in a very incredible way 
and you know I think that 
it's 
um it takes us a long time 
you know to really kind of 
understand what it is you know it's like 
it 
it all comes down to love 
everything 
and speaking of love 
so from 15 to 38. let me say that you it 
your dating was life was sort of like an 
everything bagel there was a whole 
everything that you had some good some 
bad some really really bad 
yeah you know 
i f and and really A lot of it was that 
and these weren't bad men I mean some of 
them were I mean some of them probably 
you know had just gotten out of the 
penitentiary you know where you know 
some heinous crime but 
um 
mostly it was 
that 
you know 
I was choosing the the men that matched 
my own life condition my own I was 
choosing men who matched exactly how I 
felt about my own life 
oh say that again for the people in the 
back 
he was choosing men who matched exactly 
how I felt about my own life and 
and really truly that is the honest raw 
bottom line you know I was choosing men 
that couldn't give me what I wanted I 
was choosing men that hurt me I was 
choosing men that treated me awful I was 
choosing men that 
um 
and the thing about it and I know you'll 
you'll understand this 
I look at 
photos of me now back then 
and I think oh my God I was gorgeous 
Mighty gorgeous I might be gorgeous I 
see a woman or a young woman who was 
beautiful I mean I see you know this 
um but I never I never saw that then 
so now when I look at photos of me when 
I was younger 
I think oh my God how beautiful you know 
and my hair and you know when all kinds 
of things and 
and I thought okay you know when that 
guy told me that he loved me or thought 
I was beautiful why didn't I believe him 
yeah why don't I believe the ones who 
hurt me 
because I remember there was one guy who 
actually said to me do you know how 
beautiful you are and I was like oh this 
guy is [ __ ] nuts 
this guy is certifiable this guy so 
desperately is crazy 
um but he wasn't 
because now when I see the photo of the 
woman he looked at 
I think wow he wasn't lying 
but 
um 
you know I think how we view our own 
lives we bring into our lives you know 
it's like if if you don't feel good 
about who you are in the world 
or if you don't think you're enough or 
if you don't think you're worthy or all 
of those things that we've been talking 
about for years now 
you're going to bring people in that 
kind of match that so that you can go 
see that I'm not worthy see that I'm not 
enough 
see that I'm not you know and we don't 
believe it's I think there's a great 
line from Pretty Woman where she says 
something like why do we believe the bad 
yeah 
yeah 
why do we believe that's we were 
conditioned to believe you know the bad 
stuff 
so the tiger wouldn't eat us right 
exactly fight or flight right and and 
it's fake fear and fake bad right but 
you're right those bad seeds I I always 
say we talk about this at Smart dating 
Academy it's those three to five bad 
seeds that you know I I look at us as 
there's always seeds around our heads 
right and sometimes a lot of the seeds 
just repel and they fall to the ground 
there are certain seeds that implant 
themselves in our brains into giant 
Mighty oak trees and they're always the 
bad trees yes they are the bad Chia Pet 
trees that and you gotta take it you 
gotta take a damn ax and chop down those 
bad treats because most likely the seeds 
that we allowed to plant in our brains 
if you're not pretty enough you're fat 
you're old you're this you're that that 
person has no idea they even said that 
or that we interpreted what they said 
that way exactly it's in how we 
interpret it yes and we give away our 
power and if you're listening to this I 
want you to go oh my God if this is me 
take your power back chop those trees 
down ladies and gentlemen 
and we give away our power 
because we think okay that's gonna get 
someone to love us or that's if we give 
something away whatever it is 
right whether it's our power whether 
it's things we own whether it's oh you 
like my you like my shoes here take them 
you know whatever 
um we give them away because we want 
someone to love us 
right 
and 
we can't do that anymore 
we have to love ourselves more 
and love people less who who you know 
and and the power is not power is not 
anger 
no power's not you know anger power is 
not mean power is not you know [ __ ] you 
no that is not power 
no power is peace 
yes 
is peace 
well I'm so curious 
so we go from 15 to 38 kind of doing a 
little of this doing a little of that 
you know you guys have to read this book 
maybe did one night at a topless dance 
club trying to earn some tips we've done 
we've done it all with the delightful 
Amy Ferris and then at 38 this man comes 
along 
tell us about this love story 
I had code you know what's wonderful 
about this story right now is that it 
was born out of the 1988 Writers Guild 
strike 
coincidentally 
um so 
I met this woman on the picket line 
and she and I were like the only two 
chicks that were walking around you know 
[ __ ] you WG you know [ __ ] you you know 
we're wga writers you know and we need 
to get paid and all that and 
we connected and we decided Well let's 
write a script together 
you know because that's what we did we 
were writers you know and so 
um that's how the script Mr Wonderful 
was born 
um and it 
you know you couldn't sell it when you 
were writing it but we were able to kind 
of get a little bit of attention and 
then 
um the movie got bought the script got 
bought and Anthony mingella who had 
directed truly madly deeply and was like 
the coolest guy in town 
um was looking for his first 
um kind of like Hollywood movie to 
direct 
and he got the script Mr Wonderful 
and that was it it was kind of like 
because Anthony was Anthony grew up in a 
very working class family 
in London you know I think if I'm not 
mistaken his family owned like a you 
know like an ice cream parlor Pizza 
Joint kind of thing and Anthony was a 
brilliant brilliant writer and a 
brilliant director 
and so he 
was you know directing the movie and 
I think it was the second or third day 
of shooting 
and it was downtown 
and 
um 
I went to and I also happened to have 
known Matt Dillon who was in the movie 
so it was cool to hang with him oh my 
God like I think I had 27 000 posters of 
Matt Dill he was and let me just my 
seventh grade bedroom 
Matt Dillon and was and is one of the 
kindest people on the planet 
really no you know and the cast was 
amazing it was Bill heard it was James 
Gandolfini it was Annabelle and shiora 
it was Mary Louise Parker you know it 
was it was pretty extraordinary and 
anyway so I'm standing with Matt and I'm 
chatting and there's this guy on a 
camera and he's way up on a crane and 
he's wearing a hat and he looks like 
Clint Eastwood and at that very same 
moment we looked at each other hello I 
looked up at him and back then I was 
like wearing a white T-shirt and jeans 
and nothing fancy and you know my hair 
was really wild 
and I left and I you know left and then 
that night 
um 
the production manager said hey do you 
want to join us for drinks 
and 
I said sure and 
you know I came out of my apartment and 
Ken was I went oh my God Clint Eastwood 
and he went oh my God the best because I 
was wearing a vest 
and it was like 
um and it was wild and wonderful and 
nothing happened 
nothing at all happened because Ken was 
actually involved with somebody and I 
said when you can call me 
this is how I knew everything was 
different by the way 
because I didn't go to I didn't invite 
him in and and sleep with him 
I mean you know we didn't [ __ ] in the 
elevator you know it was like I said 
when you can give me your phone number 
when you're available you're available 
and you can call and leave your phone 
number that's you know 
that's when you'll be Mr Wonderful 
that's when and you know and then what 
ended up happening which is kind of like 
I think I've even I've written about it 
so many times 
um 
he said he was gonna it was over Labor 
Day weekend 
and he said I'm gonna call you 
you know and 
I back then we didn't have cell phones 
we had like shoe boxes right it was like 
you know I mean you go out with like a 
shoe box and you call from a you know 
from a uh you know phone booth to 
collect your messages and it's like 
you're in a phone booth for 18 hours you 
know 
and he said I'll call you and he didn't 
he didn't call me and I showed up on the 
set on Tuesday 
and I marched onto the set and I was 
like filled with like just Fierce and 
fire and and he was on one more Crane 
and James Gandolfini was in the shot and 
I walked onto the set and and 
I said excuse me you you up there on the 
crane you said you were gonna call me 
you didn't [ __ ] call me I had you 
pegged as someone different [ __ ] you and 
all of a sudden this Anthony miguela 
goes okay 
um and the crane comes down and mingella 
comes over to me and he said in his 
wonderful British clip you my darling 
have a set of platinum balls 
I mean it was like I showed up on the 
set I had no you know didn't realize you 
know I'd never really been on a set I 
didn't realize you can't just barge on 
you know and while they're shooting and 
you know and all kinds of crazy read 
somebody the riot act you know when 
James Gandolfini thought I was the 
coolest girl on the planet at that 
moment and Ken came off the crane came 
down it was like The Parting of the Red 
Sea literally like the crew everybody's 
like oh geez what's gonna happen and Ken 
comes down and he was walking toward me 
and I'm like [ __ ] you 
and he said I will never do that again 
and 
I said okay 
you're gay you're on 
okay he has been calling me ever since 
it's just celebrated your 30-year 
wedding 
Street and you know I'm a handful I'm 
I'm I'm you know and Kim is 
you know he's just this 
simple kind loving generous 
man 
you know he doesn't have a whole lot of 
crazy 
you know he doesn't it's like he doesn't 
have a whole lot of 
you know weird [ __ ] going down 
I mean I you know can list mine 
alphabetical and and 
it's always astonishing to me that 
you know that he loved me so 
unconditionally 
and I think and this is really for 
everybody to hear I think when we stand 
up for what it is 
you know some people will say oh you 
made a fool of yourself or why did you 
do that or why did you show up there I 
knew that if I didn't say that if I 
didn't show up that day that afternoon 
and say to him you said you because that 
was what every man says right 
or not every man but how many women will 
say to you oh yeah or how many men will 
say to you or how many women will say 
that women you know it doesn't even 
matter our gender 
you know I'll call you and we wait for 
the phone call because we don't think 
we're enough because we don't think we 
deserve more and we sit I felt like I 
was living out like you know a Rhema 
Land movie like 
I you know I didn't want to go to the 
bathroom I had to bring my phone with me 
you know it was like so neurotic right 
every time the phone rang it was like oh 
my God it's Ken this guy from the crane 
wasn't and it was like excuse me I can't 
talk to you right now I'm waiting for a 
phone call 
have it ring busy because we don't even 
have call waiting you don't have call 
waiting right now it's like it was such 
a different time 
and 
um 
you know and and that was one that I 
that was about taking back my power 
because in that moment I didn't care if 
he was gonna call me or not call me I 
cared that I stopped that 
um 
that habit 
that bad habit 
you know it had to stop right there with 
me 
you know no man ever I didn't care if I 
was alone the rest of my life I didn't I 
really but no man I was not gonna allow 
myself 
to 
have another relationship 
with someone who 
didn't deserve the privilege of my life 
it's like you had grown into yourself 
and you didn't even know it exactly and 
I was given the opportunity 
to do it and it was with the exact right 
person 
and he came in a different package than 
you probably expected oh my God totally 
different right 
drove a Subaru pickup truck and he was a 
cameraman and you know and he was into 
gardening and I was into Barney's and 
you know and he would say yeah go get 
tomatoes so I would go to the store and 
he'd say no no we're growing tomatoes 
and we're growing them and it's like 
what do you mean we're growing tomatoes 
you know it's like he was growing 
vegetables and flowers and I was buying 
vegetables and flowers and you know and 
he's 
a good man 
he's a good good man 
and you knew what a good man was because 
your father was a good man and it's like 
when I read this I thought you know what 
she came home 
you came home with Ken thank you for 
saying that that is so gorgeous 
I did I came home with him he came home 
and 
and 
you found 
someone who loves you the way you've 
spectated that love as little Amy you 
took a 
you know a messy gorgeous path to get 
there but you found him when you 
developed 
the resolve to say 
I'm not going to give you a hall pass 
I'm gonna I'm gonna basically you said 
you called 
you would call and you didn't and I'm 
gonna call you out on that 
and you held his feet to the fire I did 
and he was ready and he was the right 
one 
right no it was yes and you know he had 
been married before you know when on our 
second on our Like official second date 
he said to me I just want you to know 
I'm never getting married again and I 
said I just want you to know that I want 
a second line that's all I just want to 
have my second glass of wine you know it 
was kind of like I'm not getting married 
again and you know it but 
but life actually threw us together in 
such a way that 
four months after we met and fell in 
love he actually asked me to marry him 
you know 
um 
and 
you know I just I can't imagine 
what you know I I just can't imagine 
how anything could be any better than it 
is for me in terms of the the road that 
I took and the journey that I took and 
that I 
that I stood up for my life 
and the moment I did that I stood up for 
love 
in some form 
you stood up and for love in a sense you 
began to love yourself absolutely 
and that was the key I will accept this 
and I will not accept these crumbs 
anymore exactly no more crumbs I want 
the pie I want the whole pie and I want 
whipped cream and I want extra and yes 
you know clean it up a little nicely too 
and maybe a la mode ala mode shoes maybe 
there should be a guy out there all a 
mode 
oh my gosh I'm starting to think this 
could be your next book all a mode 
I like that ala mode yes he was on the 
um but yes so that's 
that's my My Little Love Story which is 
messy and complicated and gorgeous 
Mighty gorgeous and what would you tell 
somebody who's listening to this right 
now and maybe they're 30 40 50 60 70 80 
and they're in their car or maybe 
they're on the treadmill and they're 
listening to us what would you tell them 
that you would want them to do for 
themselves 
I would want them 
to look themselves in the eye 
I would like for them to go and look at 
themselves in a mirror I don't care if 
it's a compact I don't care if it's a 
full limb and I want them to say 
you're the best there is 
oh my God I have like electricity in 
every body part right now I I think you 
know 
I think that we all need to love 
ourselves the way that we want others to 
love us 
and like us the way that we want others 
to like us and give to us what we want 
others to give to us 
I think that you know 
that's a really important thing is if we 
want people to love us and like us and 
respect us and honor us and 
we have to do that 
you know if we want them to give that to 
us then we need to give that to us we 
shouldn't be 
you know we shouldn't be afraid of 
giving it to ourselves 
I think there's this kind of 
false notion that if we love ourselves 
then we won't have love 
or if we like ourselves we won't have 
people or or if we treat ourselves well 
then because I think a lot of the pain 
that we suffer through is loneliness 
thinking oh my God if I like me then I 
don't need anybody to like me 
you know I think we we've we got it 
wrong along the way 
you know 
um and you know we can listen to 
everybody I know I listen to all of 
these incredible podcasts and read all 
of these things about being enough you 
know 
I think that it's more than just feeling 
like being enough 
I think it's 
knowing that who you are is pretty 
extraordinary 
exactly exactly as you are 
yeah you know we all [ __ ] up and we all 
make mistakes and we all fumble and we 
all have so many flaws and we all wish 
we could take back Things We Said and 
did and you know we all wish we could 
rewind 
120 days you know we all wish that you 
know we were more compassionate or you 
know 
but 
it's that's all of that stuff makes us 
so incredible 
it makes us understand another human 
being 
right 
totally I I often say I wish you know if 
I could create something it would be an 
undo button for my life 
but I click undo on that thing that 
I can do it online and and knowing that 
it's okay to not be perfect 
and I think we hold ourselves to these 
crazy like oh my gosh if I'm not perfect 
then my World's Gonna Fall Apart and 
people will see that I'm not perfect and 
they're not going to want to be around 
me and yet I find the people that I love 
the most in my life are the people that 
are willing to wear their imperfections 
as a as a sandwich board 
like and they're announcing it to the 
world they put it over their head and 
it's on their chest and it's on their 
back and they're walking around Times 
Square or Michigan Avenue in Chicago 
saying here's what I got and it's okay 
and those are those are people that 
you can really have a real true 
connection with and remember all of your 
stuff my dear friend my dear listener 
all the things that you think make you 
unlovable unbatable 
unrelationshipable if that's even a word 
that's a good word it's a good word 
unrelationship a ball I it's it's all Bs 
at the end of the day you are magical 
and glorious 
exactly as you are in the day that you 
do what Amy Farah says and look in the 
mirror and be like God I love this 
person look at all of the beautiful 
things I've seen I've done this exercise 
with clients and it produces tears for 
them and me every single time we look in 
a mirror together and I'll say tell me 
what you see 
tell me five things if I even talk about 
it it brings me to tears they will tell 
I look at the thighs look at the burnt 
skin on my face look at my eyes that are 
crooked and I'm like that's what you see 
isn't that amazing amazing and if you 
look in the mirror maybe look in the 
mirror you guys find someone who loves 
you an elevator person and do this 
exercise with them it will bring you to 
your knees and transform you in the most 
sparkly way what you think others see is 
not what they see 
and isn't that remarkable it's kind of 
like you know when we see a piece of art 
right let's let's for an example you 
know 
a stained glass a piece of stained glass 
and we look at it and we stare at it and 
we think oh my God how gorgeous how the 
light comes in and oh and and you know 
that's 
exactly who we are we're pieces of you 
know edgy and and misshapen and and you 
know dark and bright and so you know 
we're we we are 
and extraordinarily gorgeous mosaic 
and we're fill everything 
that we do I think the whole thing about 
perfection 
you know is so out of whack and it's 
you know what is perfect and and if we 
think about you know when we read about 
somebody taking their life right and we 
go oh my God wasn't he happy 
wasn't he didn't he have a perfect life 
didn't she you know and 
no they didn't he didn't and we and and 
Society is such that we have to 
everything needs to be perfect 
right and neat you know and and like in 
boxes and filed and you know it's like 
you can't have an overstepped 
refrigerator you know you're not allowed 
to have chantras you know but that's 
what life is 
life is a giant junk drawer if one is a 
giant drunk junk drawer it is 
you know and 
and I think that once we really really 
get that you know once people can say 
wow my life is a junctural you know I 
got all this [ __ ] in there 
you know what is it that you want to 
keep that makes you happy 
what is it that you know I'm not into 
the whole you know touch that Marie 
whatever her name is or a condo you know 
bring you Joy if not Pitch it you know 
I'm I'm I'm the chick who still has 
stuff in her closet from 1992. I 
couldn't fit in it if someone literally 
like said I'm gonna 
I'm gonna you know like rip you to 
shreds if you can't but I have I have 
stuff in my closet Ken once said to me 
Amy is this is true he said is this 
a belt and I said no Ken it's a black 
mini dress 
a black mini skirt he said oh because it 
was like this big and it was like when I 
was you know 102 pounds and I keep 
things you know it's like and he was 
like is that a belt 
I laughed and I said no Ken it was a 
skirt I used to cover my bum and you 
know it's like I keep it in my closet 
because I think wow what was I thinking 
back then you know and who was I Batman 
and you know and and all that stuff and 
I just think we need to love ourselves 
and accept 
you know all the [ __ ] that we do because 
it gets us to where we want to go 
100 
absolutely I mean and Jill you know how 
much we love Jill she's still share 
Murphy I hope you're listening she's 
like the queen of this you know 
um 
would just we're afraid to love our own 
lives 
yeah yeah and we and and we need to 
yeah and like Jill says you've got to 
let go of all the [ __ ] you've got to let 
go for what you really want and let go 
of the things you think that I think 
look at yourself in the mirror and you 
know what here's what we all do let's go 
back to this mirror metaphor guys look 
at ourselves through some damn Carnival 
mirror that makes you look short fat and 
squatty right sorted and distorted and 
that's the mirror with which we look at 
ourselves exactly that's perfect 
and I want you to metaphorically get a 
straight mirror and look at yourself and 
do this with someone that loves you and 
do the compare contrast it's going to 
knock you out of your chair if you don't 
cry write me a note 
I'll take you out to the bike racks and 
we'll duke it out Schwinn Schwinn 
Schwinn all all the way and Amy is there 
anything I didn't ask you that you want 
our listeners to know to take with them 
you know I think the only thing I would 
love for them to take away from all of 
this 
is that every single thing that we do 
the shameful things the dirty things the 
weird things 
the joyous things 
the Glorious things 
every single thing is what makes us 
extraordinary 
we're you know 
every single thing I mean I in the in my 
book in the in the very very very very 
very beginning you know I write this you 
know which is so cliched at this point 
but I write a letter to my younger self 
and 
you know and Brooke my publisher said to 
me what would you tell your younger self 
Amy really what would you tell her 
and I would tell her to do exactly what 
she's going to do because when she says 
when I grow up I want to be 
she grew up to be exactly who she wanted 
to be 
um 
and and I think that that's something 
we all need to feel better about and 
look at you know when we say that when 
we're little kids and we say when I grow 
up I want to be like her 
well 
I became exactly who that little girl 
wanted to be 
awesome 
and I and I think that that's something 
that I would want people to look at in 
their lives 
we become exactly who we want to be 
when we're those little kids 
if we in fact 
don't for one moment think we should 
have changed anything 
um 
so think about who you want to be you 
guys 
and sometimes we don't know that and we 
haven't thought about that so it's never 
too late and all this crap that's 
happened to you and if you're sitting 
there with those big negative oak trees 
in your mind I want you 
to get rid of those and no you know we 
say and I took this I think from Tony 
Robbins I can't even remember I've read 
it in so many places what you want to do 
you can look at you can look at two 
things you can say God what a mess right 
exactly 
but those who are able to find the 
meaning in the mess we're all a mess 
I can tell you I can delineate 37 messes 
that I've created in the last 37 months 
right but if you find the meaning in the 
mess 
that's where those lily pads come in 
like ah okay this is what I got from 
this and it brought me here and that's 
your story and Own It own it because if 
you didn't have the messes you all 
you've got to do is go back and find the 
meaning isn't that fun think about the 
messes and find the meaning in it and 
own it 
absolutely you know and it's it's so 
extraordinary that you and I are talking 
today the day after Tina Turner died 
yeah because her life was that example 
I mean when you read about who she was 
when she you know with 16 years of abuse 
with Ike right and you know and left and 
with 37 cents or 36 Cents and went you 
know and was on food stamps for a while 
and crazy stuff right 
um she took every bit of poison 
every bit of poison 
and turned it into medicine 
she took every single thing that 
happened to her and transformed her life 
and I think she is an extraordinary 
example of a woman or anybody who can 
say you know what I'm gonna own my power 
now 
after 60. after 60 years old it's 
extraordinary and when she you know and 
I read this today or yesterday when she 
was in court you know for her divorce 
proceedings 
and she didn't want anything 
she didn't want the house she didn't 
want you know she didn't want her the 
rights to her music she said all I want 
is a future 
that's all she wanted I mean it was kind 
of like wow 
she wanted 
she only wanted her future 
doesn't that you know it's like you 
think about it and you think here's this 
woman who we loved right and we loved 
Tina Turner not just because she was a 
fierce fiery gorgeous Queen 
we loved her because she overcame 
so much stuff 
that when she stood on that stage and 
sang and shimmied and used her body and 
used her power because we had already 
known 
that she was you know abused and used 
and hurt and you know and tried to kill 
herself and all this stuff 
so brings us right back to you know we 
root for those people 
movie theater 
and we have to start rooting for those 
people in life because 
people like Tina Turner 
really truly I mean she pulled herself 
up and out 
and maybe somebody would think oh I 
can't share that kind of story that's 
too dirty that's too messy that's to you 
know it's down and dirty ugly 
but she shared it and it's why we loved 
her 
exactly guys share your mess with others 
because we're all a mess and if you 
share your mess with me it's going to 
make me share my mess with you and 
that's how we connect and just like Amy 
said at the beginning we are love and we 
are our relationships 
that's what we are and Elevate the 
people around you be that person not 
just in a movie theater watching 
somebody else's life Elevate the people 
around you but most importantly look in 
the mirror and Elevate yourself 
and think about what you will and won't 
accept from now on and I want you to 
remember as always you guys love will 
come to you in the way you want it and 
remember it's a when it's not an if 
exactly it's a win 
it's a when okay Amy came from you know 
non-traditional you know everything and 
look at her story right and she owned it 
and she took responsibility for her own 
life and grew into herself and said this 
is what I will take and this is what I 
won't take and has that best lid to her 
pot and her love just like you've heard 
me talk about a thousand times came in 
an unexpected package so I wanted you I 
want you to be inspired that he might 
drive up in a Subaru truck he might be 
on a crane filming you or he might be on 
a train he might be sitting next to you 
on a plane he might be you know the gym 
teacher at your kid's school she might 
be the bus driver I don't know but be 
open to love and know what you will and 
you will not tolerate this time around 
because remember good love it's always 
work but it's never soul-crushing work 
overall it's easy 
I love that 
I love that and you know I just want to 
add one thing 
let's not be afraid to let people in and 
love us 
um 
I think that that's also because when 
you talk about packages 
you know 
we have an idea of who that person is 
what that person is going to look like 
or what we want right 
and a lot of those people that we think 
oh I want that that's you know that's 
the package 
yeah that package may not be kind that 
package may not be good that package May 
not have a real long shelf life 
you know I think 
I think we just listening to you made me 
just go wow you know 
we want love but then we kind of 
push it away or keep it a distance or 
you know think oh no that's not 
you know I think we also have to really 
talk about what it is that love looks 
like 
um 
you know what is what what are you look 
are you really looking for love or are 
you looking for something else 
right 
you know 
maybe it's that we don't really know 
what how to describe what love is 
you know that's something you know 
that's that you're making me think about 
right now is you know what what do we 
think love is 
oh that is like that is going to be our 
podcast I got you that's true that's 
like what do we think love is 
love oh I will tell you what love is a 
verb it's not a noun it's an action it's 
not a feast 
exactly 
and you know that and I know that and I 
think anybody who's really honest with 
themselves don't mistake chemistry for 
love lust is Nature's Way of tricking us 
into attachment okay 
that's what I would that's very true 
that is perfect that is so just that is 
so true right and that's where you get 
into messy love you all let's just call 
that messy lust at the end of the day 
right 
who has had that so Amy you are 
remarkable as a human being and I I'm 
gonna I'm going to say you are now my
