we're gonna get geeky we're gonna talk 
about chat GPT and what the hell it is 
and how this is going to affect 21st 
century dating I have landed on the side 
Bella that chat GPT could actually be a 
very powerful tool for dating I don't 
know how I feel about AI generated 
images I think that less so that's a 
little creepy and crazy yes and we have 
enough of enough problems with catfish 
and people using fake photos I don't 
even need to deal with it it's like 
overall torturing right it's like we've 
got we don't need a generated photos 
that make us look like Kim Kardashian no 
AI still in its infancy and I think the 
tools are going to continue to be 
improved it's kind of like having 
somebody take over your online dating 
app for you
