I'm not pretty does he like me uh he's 
he's Baler than his pictures he doesn't 
make enough money he he doesn't make 
enough money the thoughts that track is 
in our way of creating the talk is in 
our way of having access to being 
psychotically up so it's just our 
thoughts and when we can learn how to 
identify oh these are just my thoughts 
it's just my fear and to work with I 
forgive myself for judging myself as not 
enough I forgive myself for judging him 
as bald and not making enough money and 
the truth is we're all whole complete 
and beautiful souls right and if we can 
just get some altitude and some space 
from that negative barrage then we can 
show up with another human being and 
really connect from there which is like 
completely revolutionary 100%
