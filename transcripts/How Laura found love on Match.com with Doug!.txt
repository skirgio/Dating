the other thing that really helped was 
kind of act like you've already found 
the person or that you know they're out 
there there were times where I was like 
oh my God this is so depressing I'm 
never going to meet him I'm sick of 
looking act as if it's a when not an if 
yes yes negative psychotic optimism 
you've got act like I know he's out 
there all I have to do is keep running 
the Iron Man stay on the path and I will 
find him and that's because primes you 
it puts you in a place of hope and it 
gives you the positivity to be able to 
see someone because if you are down and 
out believing he or she is never going 
to be there you're not going to see 
that
