[Music] 
a couple days ago I get a text dear 
Bella have you ever had a client that 
was on a dating app and saw someone 
else's significant other or someone that 
they're dating on a dating app do I tell 
the person I told someone once and they 
stopped talking to me what do I do 
before you Lop this Grenade on someone 
else or really think about how close is 
your relationship to this person are you 
comfortable that this person would trust 
you do you have this person's best 
intentions at heart and once you really 
take accountability of those questions 
then by all means feel free to have the 
courage to tell that person I think I 
might see be seeing something I don't 
know if it's true but I wanted you to 
know what I saw
