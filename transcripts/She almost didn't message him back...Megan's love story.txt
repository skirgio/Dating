you know I did a fair amount of dating 
but just never really quite met the 
right guy a lot of my friends in their 
you know late 20s were starting to pair 
up and you know get married and but I 
made a conscious decision to just find 
someone who's going to enhance my life 
not like just finding a guy to check a 
box and get married and and have 
children but then I really got to a 
point where I when I reached out to you 
was I want a partner in my life so I 
think I have found the right balance 
it's been a great journey not every 
single day is perfect but like I think I 
told you he's you know the lid for my 
pot but sometimes the lid you know pops 
off needs to get readjusted 
exactly
