my guess today is 
truly 
the definition of a badass woman you 
know my argument in all of my work is 
don't do what you love don't follow your 
passion instead do what you are i think 
there's power in this not just in your 
career but in your love life and it took 
so much self-discovery and so many 
layers to get back into the heart of who 
i am 
and carry that not just into my career 
and my love life but everywhere that i 
go and in my work in so many ways so 
it's changing your mindset around this 
which is what i love you can 
take chances guys you can experiment 
look at finding 
the job that you love the career that 
you love the person that you love you're 
going to have to go through iterations 
and take chances and not say well i want 
the third person i date to become my 
husband it's not going to happen
