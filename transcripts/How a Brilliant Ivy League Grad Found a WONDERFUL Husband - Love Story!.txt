welcome to the Smart dating Academy 
podcast I'm bellagande the founder of 
Smart dating Academy and your host I 
started Smart dating Academy in 2009

worked that I took I've been married for 
almost 25 years and now my company helps 
people to date smarter and to find love 
this podcast is meant to bring more love 
into your life no matter where you are 
and what you do and we're here to bring 
more life into your love smartdators 
welcome back to this week's episode and 
this week is especially special for me 
because it's someone that I know and 
love and met three years ago and her 
name is Anushka and she is a Smart 
dating client former client because now 
she's found the lidoor pot and 
um current friend so Anushka welcome to 
the podcast I'm so glad you're here 
thank you I'm excited to be here and I 
know we talked about sharing my story so 
I'm finally ready to share it with the 
world oh my gosh you guys okay so she 
said when we were working together we 
were talking about something and her 
photos were so pretty or I must have 
asked her like can I pop can I like 
share your photos on a TV segment as I 
do like before and afters I must have 
said something she's like Bella once I 
get engaged you can share my story far 
and wide so guess what not only is she 
engaged but 
she's already married so we're so 
excited for you to tell us where you 
were what your journey was and how you 
got to where you are now so 
um you and I met three years ago and why 
don't you just start out with like a 
little bit of background about you your 
family where you were how you grew up 
give us the goods yeah sure so I guess 
from the time I've I was young I've 
always been pretty type A and pretty 
driven 
um I am from a South Asian family both 
my parents Sri Lankan 
um I don't know how much that had to do 
with how driven I am or how crazy and 
type A I am but if I'm guessing it 
played a little part in it probably a 
small for probably many of us on this 
podcast call 
but I always had a clear idea in my mind 
from the time I was very little of like 
exactly what I wanted to achieve in life 
and then the timeline I wanted to 
achieve it on 
so from the time I was probably 10 I was 
like I need to go to an Ivy League 
college and then I need to get a really 
good job and then I want to get married 
by the time I'm 27 and then I want to 
have two kids by the time I'm 35 and 
that was like the perfect picture that I 
painted for myself that was like the 
epitome of success of what my future 
would look like that's what so many of 
us think right it's like you sit there 
and you Daydream like yes I'm gonna go 
to an Ivy League school and yes I'm 
gonna get married and yes I'm going to 
have kids as if it all just magically 
happens when it should and pops into our 
laps right and exactly and sometimes 
that happens but a lot of times it 
doesn't happen 
it doesn't happen so so now what happens 
so you make it did you go to an Ivy 
League school you did you did 
um yeah I did and I kind of like felt 
like I you know was really achieving 
everything I wanted to achieve in terms 
of my job and my schooling and my 
background I had a ton of friends 
um but as I started to get into like my 
late 20s I started to question oh shoot 
like this timeline I've set for myself 
on getting married and having kids is 
starting to look less and less realistic 
um and so that started to worry me 
um 
at the time I guess by the time I was 30 
I had moved to Boston I had finished 
grad school where I got my second ivy 
league degree 
um with us where you went just to 
inspire all of us 
um for undergrad I went to UPenn and for 
grad I went to uh the tuck School of 
Business which is at darknet so two very 
different experiences but um experiences 
that I think got me where I am today 
both in terms of personal and 
professional life 
um so I think that's how it gets 
interesting but yeah so I moved to 
Boston and 
um started to realize like shoot I'm 27. 
I thought I was going to be married at 
this point 
um at that point I had one serious 
relationship which was my boyfriend that 
I had met in grad school 
um and that didn't pan out very well no 
I was a great guy but he just wasn't the 
right person for me yeah he realized 
that before I did so that was tough 
he came to that conclusion before I did 
and I accepted into that conclusion 
before I did but I do like to think that 
like at least I had that one bad breakup 
experience so now I can commiserate and 
understand like what other people are 
going through when they're going through 
a breakup because that never I never 
understood like how it could be so 
heartbreaking and I would look at others 
that were going through a breakup and 
just like laugh at them and be like 
they're ridiculous 
um so I think it built my empathy for 
for other people it's so sucky isn't it 
it's terrible 
it was terrible but in hindsight 
definitely the best thing for me 
um and for him 
but yeah so then at that point I had 
moved to Boston I was 30 
um had a great group of friends in 
Boston had the most amazing apartment 
had like my dream job out of grad school 
but 
um had spent a lot of time on online 
dating apps and could not get a date 
like I think I shared with you like in 
our first meeting or even when I reached 
out to you actually that like I've been 
on these apps for like three years now 
I can get matches which I don't think I 
really even got that many matches 
compared to my friends but like I can't 
get a person to respond to my messages 
we're like what 
I don't know what was happening but I 
just like went on maybe two dates in 
three years like 
it was even though I was actively trying 
um and so at that point I started to get 
like really worried 
um really down on myself like my friends 
were like don't worry you're a great cat 
like you're awesome you're gonna find 
someone it just takes time and I'm like 
but I've been trying like for three 
years and I haven't gotten anywhere 
um that must have been hard 
yeah it was really hard like all my 
friends were starting to get married 
um or they were engaged or most of them 
were in serious relationships and so I 
could just start to see people like 
achieving that timeline that I was so 
um fixated on and I was just felt like I 
was like falling behind 
um but then I also started to realize 
like not only am I falling behind my 
timeline but I'm also like potentially 
going to be alone forever oh that really 
felt scary 
right you're like what are the 
consequences of not meeting the 
objective plan yeah exactly it's like 
okay the timeline probably doesn't 
matter as much as just finding someone 
that is going to be the right person for 
me to spend the rest of my life with 
um so I actually started Weight Watchers 
because I was convinced that it had 
something to do with my weight 
um on why I wasn't meeting anyone I 
guess for reference I'm most people 
would probably say I'm not overweight 
we're not I've seen you I don't think I 
knew this part of the story 
but yeah I was like okay it must have 
like if I was skinnier it would be 
easier to meet someone 
um and so I started Weight Watchers and 
through Weight Watchers started 
following these like fit fluencers on 
Instagram 
um and like love to look at their Pages 
for inspiration and one of the people I 
started following was someone on 
Instagram with the handle everything 
Erica yeah everything Erica Erica Eckman 
and she also had a podcast that I 
stumbled upon through her Instagram and 
there were a couple episodes on the 
podcast where Bellows featured and Smart 
dating Academy was featured and it was 
all about like how to find the right 
relationship and I was like oh my God I 
need This Woman's help 
so I was like all my prayers have been 
answered like let me just reach out to 
this person and see if she can help me 
and so that's how I heard about you and 
when I first reached out to you 
wow and do you remember what was our 
first interaction like and then what 
happened 
um I think it was a phone call 
um and you just started talking to me 
and I was just so struck by like how 
effusive your personality was and how 
you just like understood what I was 
going through and 
I think you were just like I can help 
you like there's there like you know 
this isn't like rocket science I can 
help you 
um and so it just gave me a lot of Hope 
um that 
I've always been a great student I feel 
like I can study really hard and pass a 
test and it just gave me hope that like 
maybe there is maybe I'm doing this 
wrong and like I there's a teacher that 
can teach me how to do this and I can be 
a great student I know I can do that so 
it just gave me a ton of hope that like 
things could turn around I hope for 
those of you listening you're hearing 
this and maybe you've listened to so 
many things and you've read so many 
things and you've done all the things 
but if you find yourself like Anushka 
going okay I've been doing this for 
three years five years 10 years 20 years 
and it's not working just know that 
there are ways to get help through this 
process sometimes we feel so isolated 
and like we're the last single person on 
Earth and maybe we're too damaged like 
you said I'm too heavy I'm too old I'm 
never gonna find love and all that stuff 
all of these things multiply in our 
heads but we're here to tell tell you 
number one there is help and you are 
incredibly lovable as you are just like 
I said to Anushka like you can do this 
we can help you so so we have this 
conversation you're like Yay let's do 
this so now you fly to Chicago and what 
happens 
yeah which is where we're based if 
you're a new listener we're based in 
Chicago and we do photo shoots and fun 
stuff here 
yeah so I flew to Chicago 
um and was excited to meet with you and 
Lindsay we met up and I just remember 
that first meeting which was like 
several hours long I was really excited 
because it was at the Four Seasons so I 
was just excited for lunch at the Four 
Seasons 
um but also to get started and and to to 
change my life hopefully 
um and so I remember in that first 
meeting one of the things you asked me 
to do was like list out all the 
characteristics I was looking for in my 
ideal person 
and 
I've had this list of probably like 30 
40 things I was looking for that had 
been in my head from the time I was 12. 
probably of like all the things I was 
looking for someone who's smarter than 
me someone who has a better job than me 
someone who's like physically attractive 
someone who's tall someone who's good 
with my family just like the list went 
on and on and on 
and you basically said okay that's a 
great list great job with that exercise 
and I was like great I've like really 
nailed it 
and you were like okay now we're gonna 
rip up this list because this is not 
what you should be looking for in a 
partner 
um this like has no relevance to what 
you're looking for and we did that 
exercise where 
I think we you helped asked me to think 
about people in my life that made me 
feel really good to be around yeah and 
your elevator people yeah and describe 
the characteristics of those people 
and you help me realize that's actually 
what I should be looking for in a 
partner 
and do you remember what were the most 
important things that came out of your 
list your elevator list 
yeah I think it was really just feeling 
being around people who made me feel 
supported and loved 
um and 
yeah who just felt good to be around 
um where I felt my best when I was 
around them it was hard to pinpoint like 
exact characteristics but it was just 
this more of like a feeling than a list 
of of things that that I wanted 
100 and I have the list by the way of 
course as I save everybody's list but 
yeah it you know and abiding by 
those things that really make you happy 
as one of the touch points for finding a 
partner that makes you happy helps you 
avoid all the crap that we're fed by 
Society like oh you need to have 
butterflies in your stomach right 
because butterflies are just red flags 
so so so we started to date in a 
different way but so after we did our 
lunch at the photo shoot now you knew 
personally after this three-hour meeting 
who exactly your high GHQ guy is who he 
might not be after we ripped up the 
first list haha or we kind of merge the 
list let's say yeah and then what 
happened the next day and how was that 
the next day 
um I think I was like so I if you 
haven't already heard or if it's not 
obvious yet I love food I was excited 
about the Four Seasons lunch and 
um one of the main things I was excited 
about being in Chicago for was just like 
the great restaurants so totally I had 
my list of restaurants that I was 
excited to go to and I don't even 
remember if I made reservations but I 
probably did make recipes that's what we 
do I took them yeah 
um but I had never eaten dinner alone at 
a restaurant and 
um I was like I told you and Lindsay 
about that and you were like oh my gosh 
yeah like ghosted at the bar and I was 
like yeah my goal is to just like make 
conversation with the person sitting 
next to me no matter who they are and I 
went to Girl On The Go and I did that 
so and it was a male who I like I guess 
another thing I left out is that like 
I've always been intimidated by guys 
um like I have a ton of girlfriends but 
I don't have a lot of male friends 
um just because I've found it much 
easier to build a connection with 
females than with males 
um but I was able to strike up a 
conversation with this random 
like young man sitting next to me 
um so I just felt felt good about 
getting out of my comfort zone and doing 
that and I was inspired by both of you 
to do that so did you hear that on day 
one okay 
knows who are high GHQ guy is and can 
flirt while sitting at a bar right I 
mean that's amazing high five through 
the Audio Waves to you so that's amazing 
so now you've had two amazing meals 
you've flirted your way around the bar 
at the girl in The Goat no so the next 
day you show up at our photo studio in 
the West Loop yep yep 
and I remember being a little bit 
skeptical I guess of the photo shoot and 
like how are we gonna make sure that 
these photos don't look like you know 
obviously cheesy clown photographer and 
like you know yeah I didn't want them to 
come off as you know making it obvious 
that I I used a professional to get my 
dating profile photos 
um but I was very prevalently surprised 
by the experience 
um the makeup team did an amazing job I 
like have hated getting my makeup done I 
hate like I never wear makeup or I would 
put on some makeup for a first date but 
I rarely wear makeup um in my day to day 
and I generally hate the way I look when 
I get my makeup done by someone else but 
the makeup team it looked amazing 
um and yeah I just loved how we went to 
like a variety of different spots 
um so it wasn't all just like in one 
place 
um I changed outfits several times so we 
were able to get like a casual look and 
like a more Glam look 
um and then also what I thought was 
probably important which I had been 
missing was like full body shots so that 
people could see 
you know didn't feel like you're holding 
something back so your post Weight 
Watchers bod 
[Laughter] 
so yeah the photo shoot was great 
um and yeah the pictures looked amazing 
like I was shocked at how good they left 
to the point where my sister says that I 
catfished my current husband with my 
phone 
oh my God and he would totally disagree 
with that yeah yeah he would probably 
disagree he would totally disagree 
you're just as beautiful and I'll put a 
page on the you know you guys can check 
out the page on our website to see how 
beautiful Anushka really is both during 
this podcast as well as in her photo 
shoot and at her wedding so she's being 
very humble 
um and so and so what happens now you're 
back on the East Coast yeah and you 
start dating yeah so I was like very 
energized coming out of our meeting in 
Chicago and what I loved was that you 
and Lindsay just gave me a formula to 
follow 
and it was like get on the apps you know 
you help me with my profile you gave me 
the photos 
um so my profile was done I started 
getting back on the apps that I was 
previously on like I think Bumble was 
the main one 
um and maybe hinge but I can't like 
Bumble was where I had the most success 
um but yeah she made it super formulaic 
of like spend 30 minutes a day on the 
app like yep that could be swiping that 
could be responding to messages 
um but whatever it is don't spend more 
or less than that 
um they gave me a formula of like 
how many dates to have per week like 
what my pipeline should look like I was 
like this is great like I can you know I 
can build a pipeline and like you know 
and filter people through it 
um so it was really helpful to just like 
think about it 
in term like in similar ways to how I 
think about like work where it's like oh 
there's data involved and there is 
um a process and you know a formula to 
how to be successful so I found that 
super helpful 
um and immediately like I started 
getting 
dates 
it was shocking I was like wow I've been 
on more dates in like a month than I was 
had been on in three years that is 
amazing oh my gosh say that again for 
the people in the back 
like the dates 
flying in like it was way more than I'd 
ever seen in terms of activity on on the 
apps that I'd been on for three years 
and just for the record sometimes people 
you know over Photoshop and Glam up and 
filter their photos we have a zero 
Photoshop policy right now one thing 
sometimes people are like wow can you 
just shave down my stomach a little bit 
or get rid of it come of those wrinkles 
under my eyes no people want to date the 
person in the picture so regardless of 
the ribbing that your sister gives you 
you look exactly like your photos and 
are like the goal is when people meet 
you they're like okay God you look just 
like your photos if not a little bit 
better right so it's never like oh I've 
been catfished right it's like here I am 
and I'm the best version of myself and 
you're gonna show up as that version to 
the date yeah 
yes so I did put makeup on so 
they're like wow you look just like your 
photos so so what started happening with 
the date so you're getting a lot of 
dates some good some bad The Good the 
Bad the Ugly how was it all of the above 
yeah there were some pretty decent dates 
there were some really really terrible 
dates 
um where like yeah I was immediately 
able to identify red flags probably only 
a handful of times like there weren't 
that many people that I encountered that 
threw up red flags but yeah I remember 
one guy I went to meet him for a drink 
and he asked we started talking about 
um or I think he just talked about 
himself the whole time he didn't ask me 
a single question and like the questions 
that he did he did finally asked me a 
question it was something about like oh 
where is your family from and I said oh 
we're from Sri Lanka and he was like oh 
do they have like indoor plumbing there 
do they have indoor plumbing yeah 
basically it was like oh it's like do 
you have a flushable toilet in Sri Lanka 
and I was just like oh my God I this 
person is just so offensive 
and he just kept asking more questions 
that were more and more offensive so 
that was definitely the worst date I 
went on but 
um 
it was ridiculous 45 minutes of my life 
before he asked me if I wanted a second 
drink and I was like no that's okay bye 
no I'm good I'm good I need to go work 
on flushing my toilet yeah yeah that was 
absolutely terrible but yeah other than 
that I think I had some like decent 
dates there was definitely people I went 
on like several dates with 
um but yeah it wasn't really finding 
many people that I was like oh like you 
know this person makes me feel like that 
list of things that I was like my new 
list of your new most characteristics I 
was looking for and it was kind of 
mutual I don't I mean maybe there were a 
couple guys that were like oh shocked 
that I didn't want to keep seeing them 
but for the most important part I think 
most of the people that I didn't 
continue dating were 
you know it was a mutual decision 
um 
I didn't mention it before but I 
actually 
um before I met you and Lindsay and 
after I continued to ask my parents to 
set me up 
um as like another potential Avenue to 
meet people and I don't know why I kept 
doing it because 
they just like the number of people that 
my parents set me up with it was 
probably like three guys 
um total but like every single one of 
them was just like a complete flop I 
don't know why I didn't learn after the 
first two times that's the third time it 
could be like a week you have a pulse 
and he has a pulse he's single you're 
single oh yeah he lives in Saskatchewan 
no yeah literally literally literally 
um like all the guys none of the guys 
lived in the US so you know I have 
family in London so I would go to visit 
my family in London and my parents 
wouldn't set me up on a date with 
someone who lived there and I was like I 
have a career in the U.S like why are 
you trying to move me to England 
um so yeah so you know along with the 
dating apps was also trying to get my 
parents to continue to set me up with 
people and they would always try to find 
me like a doctor who like comes from a 
good family and you know like typical 
kind of South Asian parent things that 
they're looking for 
um but a few months into working with 
you I remember I was telling Lindsay 
that like my parents had found another 
potential person for me 
um and he was a doctor and came from the 
family but he lived in Canada 
so I remember like talking to Lindsay 
and she was like no like there's no harm 
like just you know 
talk to him and see like how it goes so 
I had a few phone conversations with him 
and they seemed pretty good like I was 
like oh like he's easy to talk to uh 
like I you know there wasn't any red 
flags 
um and 
at a certain point he asked uh if I 
would be interested in meeting up I 
think Lindsay said like don't make a 
trip to him like you don't want to put 
yourself out there 
um on that level like that's a big 
commitment but he offered to come to me 
um and Lindsay's advice was like yeah 
that's great just like don't commit to 
more than just dinner and I was like 
okay yeah great like I don't feel like 
you know having to babysit this person 
over a weekend in Boston yeah this 
person who I've never met 
um looking back on it there was 
definitely a couple like potential red 
flags before he got to Boston but one of 
them was like the second time I talked 
to him he wouldn't stop complaining 
about his parents oh and I was like 
that's kind of weird like you haven't 
met me you don't really know me like why 
are you complaining about your parents 
he also like trash talked a person that 
we a mutual friend and I was like you 
know that that person's my friend so why 
are you speaking badly about her 
so there was a couple red flags I did 
talk to my mom about them and she was 
like oh no that's fine that's not a 
weird thing to do she was like you would 
do that and I was like no I wouldn't do 
that to someone I just met and pause on 
this part guys everybody fancies 
themselves being a dating expert and 
giving you good advice no that's not a 
red flag that's not a red flag we have 
Anushka as you know we have a plan we 
have lists of red flags okay by phases 
of dating and somebody who's talking 
negatively of other people or mean to 
others but not mean to you these are all 
instant screen people out red flags 
right if this person right because a lot 
of negativity on the outside is like 
negativity on the inside if I'm gonna 
Trash Talk someone it's because I'm 
trash talking myself a lot and that is 
nothing you can fix and Lord knows we 
don't need any fixer-uppers in our 
dating funnels exactly 
sorry Mama yeah she was wrong 
but yeah so anyway he decided he we set 
a date and he came to Boston and I had 
planned a restaurant for us to go to for 
dinner 
um and I remember meeting him there and 
that negativity Trend just continued 
throughout the night to the point where 
like we sat down for dinner and he was 
like oh it's really loud in here should 
we just go somewhere else and I was like 
well I picked this restaurant on purpose 
because I liked the food at the 
atmosphere 
so no we're not leaving 
um and I just I can't remember all the 
details but all I remember was just like 
it was like negative common after 
negative common after negative comment 
and I was like I just don't need this 
level of negativity in my life no and 
you can hear it right away and so often 
when we're dating and we've got that 
time clock and that oh my God I need to 
meet someone right away we just settle 
for these things right but now you were 
a smart dater and you knew okay red 
flags only become brighter red yeah 
right and so now he's like a blaring red 
flag and so we leave the date so we 
leave the date and just to be nice I was 
like okay he's hasn't been to Boston 
before he's flown all the way from 
Canada I was like okay there's the 
walking tour of Boston tomorrow morning 
would you want to meet up for that and 
he was like okay yeah that sounds good 
so I texted him the details of 
where to meet and when and I was like 
you'll have plenty of time before your 
flight leaves on Sunday night like to 
catch to get to the airport and catch 
your flight 
um and it was probably like 15 degrees 
that day 
um on that Sunday where we're waiting 
for doing this walking tour it was 
freezing but he was from Canada so I was 
like he should be able to handle walking 
around in the cold you're from Canada 
um but of course he was complaining 
about the cold the whole time 
and he also I think people find this 
money like my mom loves when I tell this 
story because she just thinks the story 
is hilarious brune also loves this story 
he's heard it about 15 times 
um but he came to the walking tour on 
the cobblestone streets of Boston with 
his rolly suitcase 
and I was like why did you bring your 
rolling suitcase on a walking tour you 
were staying in a hotel you could have 
left it with the doorman and I already 
told you you had plenty of time before 
your flight 
um so he was like oh yeah I guess that's 
a good point like I could have done that 
um 
like when I lived in Boston I never even 
rolled my rolling suitcase when I was 
going to the airport because it was just 
so loud I would just carry it everywhere 
so rolling suitcase dude is now walking 
throughout Boston and you're counting 
the minutes before I'm counting the 
women's suitcase tour is over yes I'm 
just like dying for this toward end 
um and it finally does and I'm like okay 
like I need to go home 
um it's Sunday I need to prepare for the 
week ahead 
and he's like oh okay I still have a few 
hours before my flight I was like okay 
I'll drop you at a coffee shop 
um and with some like resistance we walk 
into three different coffee shops 
because he was like oh there there isn't 
a seat and he was like complaining about 
you know the lack of seats in the coffee 
shop so I finally get to a coffee shop 
where there's one seat available and 
he's like oh but but what about you 
there's only one seat and I'm like oh no 
don't worry I'm gonna go home uh bye so 
I remember like walking home from that 
date and at this point I think it was 
like four o'clock or something and I had 
another first date scheduled for that 
night at seven o'clock and I was like 
I can't go on this this next date like I 
this whole last two days have just been 
exhausting you've been in like 
negativities too yeah 
um it's freezing and I was about to text 
this person to try to reschedule but I 
was like no you know what just like suck 
it up and do it let's go 
and so that night is when I met Varun 
yay hey see everyone even off the heels 
of wacko rolly suitcase negative guy you 
dusted off 
and you did it and you went on the date 
now you guys had met on the app now back 
us up a little bit yep so we had met on 
the app probably like a few days before 
the first date 
um what I liked about Varun was that he 
was 
positive 
from the interactions we've had on the 
app in our messages and and we chatted a 
little bit back and forth but he was 
pretty quick to ask me on a first date 
um I didn't follow the part of the 
process where I did the phone call 
that's okay rule Breakers fine 
but um I agreed to meet him for a drink 
so 
um yeah the plan was to meet up I didn't 
know too much about him other than like 
I think he mentioned that like he had 
been out with his family in New York and 
um he had been out to some good 
restaurants and things like that he had 
also mentioned the other thing that 
stood out to me was like he had asked me 
like if I liked my job 
um on the app and he said like I love my 
job and what I'm learning is that like 
most people don't actually like their 
jobs and I was like oh wow that is 
actually pretty refreshing to have 
someone who like actually loves what 
they do because I don't know that I can 
say that I like genuinely love what I do 
like I don't hate it but it's not 
something I'm like excited to go to work 
to do every day so 
um I think I just was surprised and 
refreshed I found it refreshing that he 
was just positive 
um so yeah so I was like excited to meet 
him but not like you know oh this is the 
one like from the interactions we'd had 
on the apps right especially coming off 
of bad dates sometimes we can have those 
gray dark lenses on like oh here we go 
again you know here comes Mr positivity 
loves his job like great so you go meet 
him for a drink and 
um and I think I immediately felt like 
pretty comfortable he was very Charming 
which I was a little worried was the red 
flag 
where I was like oh is he like too 
smooth like he turns this on for like 
every girl 
um where he just like always had the 
right thing to say 
um 
yeah and so I was a little bit worried 
from from the first date that like maybe 
he's just like a player who you know 
dates a lot of girls and doesn't get 
serious but 
um the conversation was really easy 
um he asked a lot of questions which I 
thought was really nice 
and 
um yeah I just like felt good and 
comfortable being around him 
and 
given it was Sunday night he did ask if 
I wanted to have another drink and I was 
like I want to see him like I think I 
made it clear like yeah it would be 
great to see you again but I need to go 
home because at this point it had been 
too many hours of dating for one weekend 
um totally 
and he asked me before we left 
um if I'd like to see him again and we 
had both talked about how we like Ramen 
um and so he suggested that we meet up 
for ramen at this place in Cambridge 
close to where I work and close to where 
he lived 
um to 
um yeah to meet up for a second date on 
Friday but he said there's no pressure 
to let me know now like even think about 
it and let me know 
um if you're up for it again so charming 
and and now we know just from a good 
place not a player like that's just it's 
like a good person who's courteous yeah 
exactly 
um and so yeah so then I was excited I 
think a little bit but not like so 
excited leaving where I was like oh okay 
that was like much I'm glad I went on 
this date like that was better than I 
than the average date that I've been on 
but not like the best date I've ever 
been on 
um 
but then he followed up the next day 
um so like I really liked how he was 
really proactive and I think he asked me 
a question because I had said how I go 
to Soul cycle on Tuesday or on like 
Tuesday mornings or something and he was 
like oh like how was like did you go to 
Soul cycle this morning and I was like 
oh no you know Tuesday is my soul cycle 
day and today's Monday so no I just went 
to the gym so I remember being like on 
the treadmill and getting this text from 
him 
um and I think pretty quickly after that 
I told him yeah like I'd love to meet up 
on Friday 
um but this was February 14th like the 
first date was February 9th and the 
second date was scheduled for Friday 
February 14th which you only now realize 
after you say yes to meeting up on 
Friday like this is dun 
dun's day 
and I think I realized it but I was like 
oh my God does he realize it should I 
tell him it's Valentine's Day and be 
like we can reschedule if you want like 
is he gonna think this is too big of a 
commitment is it going to be awkward for 
us to be on a second date with all these 
people that are gonna help from 
Valentine's Day so obviously I was like 
overthinking 
the whole thing but ended up just not 
saying anything about it and just not 
addressing it and you know we plan to 
meet up on Friday and we did 
um and I asked him on the date I was 
like did you know that today is 
Valentine's Day and he was like yeah but 
like he was like some of my friends 
asked me if I was going to bring you 
flowers but I thought that would be 
overkill for a second date so I was like 
yeah I'm glad you did it like this let's 
just have wrong let's just treat it like 
a normal day and not acknowledge the 
Valentine's day part of it 
um so yeah the second date was really 
good I remember like 
um just having a really good time and 
was able to like be more myself I think 
and like open up a little bit more than 
I had on the first date where I was like 
pretty tired and kind of over it 
um so yeah from the second date I think 
is when I started to realize maybe this 
could be someone that 
could be a longer term relationship 
now let's put this into perspective this 
is February 14 2020. yeah okay 
just before the world's about to end a 
month later 
right so now you're on two dates not 
knowing that we are walking into a 
freaking pandemic right no it's still 
normal we're hearing little bits and 
blips of what's going on in China and I 
don't even know if Seattle or New York 
had opened up by that point maybe the 
very first glimpses so so now what 
happens you start you're you've still 
got your funnel going yes I still have 
my funnel going I'm still messaging new 
people setting up new first dates but I 
think 
we had a pretty good Cadence of like 
meeting up every few days every week 
once a week probably 
um and 
yeah I think all those subsequent dates 
were just like more and more natural 
like I started to feel better and better 
about it with each time I met him 
um but I was still following the process 
and not trying to like be exclusive too 
early 
um and 
I remember there was like one Converse 
like we had gone on a date my camera it 
was like a lunch date or something and 
he had told me 
um you know I'm not seeing any other 
people 
um 
and kind of just put that out there I 
don't know if he asks me like 
specifically to be exclusive but he kind 
of put it out there and I was like oh 
shoot 
he's just told me this like now I need 
to tell him that I still am dating other 
people and like in fact I think I had a 
date the next day or that night I don't 
even remember 
um a first date 
and I felt really guilty having to tell 
him that but I felt like I needed to be 
honest yeah I like saw it going further 
um so later on he told he was pretty 
cool about it like I think he was just 
like okay yeah like I think he might 
have said like take your time or 
something like that but he he wasn't 
like 
you know 
like live it or you know didn't have 
that crazy reaction that's a very 
important point right because sometimes 
we wonder is this person too Charming 
are they too grandios blah blah blah you 
date him slow you've been on several 
dates he says I'm not dating anybody you 
say well 
I am now that is an excellent litmus 
test at that point if somebody is going 
to be a bad partner for you potentially 
they're going to wig out freak out go 
crazy if they potentially are going to 
be a good partner for you they can take 
an answer that maybe they weren't 
expecting or they don't like and still 
be like all right that's cool I'll be 
patient you take your time right because 
when a man wants to be with you he'll 
move mountains to be with you and he'll 
be as patient as you need him to so if 
somebody says to you well I'm not dating 
anybody else and when you say well you 
know I'm a smart dater I'm keeping my 
funnel active and he's like oh my God 
right and we've had situations blow up 
with people before where the other 
person gets crazy that is a red flag 
right there how do people react Under 
Pressure how do people react when 
something doesn't go their way super 
crucial bit of information so you you 
know we like all these little litmus 
tests as we're helping our clients date 
well how does he react if he has a good 
reaction he stays in in the funnel and 
if he has a bad reaction bye so Varun 
clearly was making Leaps and Bounds in 
these Smart dating uh lexicon yeah I 
mean he was 
from the first time I met him I was like 
he is much more emotionally aware than I 
am we loved him from day water yeah just 
like a better person in general 
um and better at maintaining 
relationships like whether it be with 
his family or his friends or 
um probably with me 
um but yeah so I remember going on 
another first date and it was just like 
a little bit painful 
um the guy there was nothing wrong with 
the guy but I was just like oh this is 
just like not I'm not having fun I don't 
feel the same way as I do when I'm 
hanging out with Varun 
um and I think a few days later after we 
had that conversation after I went on 
the the other first date with another 
guy I was like okay 
um he told he tells me now I don't 
remember this but I apparently asked him 
to be exclusive 
hahaha 
you're like okay I'm jumping out like 
let's do this right and this is under 
the careful watch of both Lindsay and me 
right we're not letting anybody go Rogue 
yeah into a red flag situation but he 
presented so beautifully literally from 
day one you're right incredibly kind 
warm emotionally intelligent able to 
navigate conflicts and misunderstandings 
yeah really well 
and so yeah and so then like a few days 
later probably the pandemic hit and I 
think that was a point where like it 
could have been terrible for our 
relationship 
um or it could have been great and 
luckily for us I think it was like 
really just something that like 
accelerated everything 
for us because pretty quickly you know 
we weren't able to see anybody else we 
really just saw each other 
um and ended up spending a lot more time 
together than we would have been able to 
um in a pre-pandemic environment 
and did that bring you closer together 
oh yeah definitely I mean I think we got 
like very close 
very quickly 
um and actually like enjoyed spending 
time together and spending all that time 
together didn't like push us apart or 
make us realize like there were 
qualities that we didn't like in each 
other 
um and so yeah I think I I'm thankful at 
this point for the pandemic because it 
actually 
helped us to get closer together 
um and progress our relationship much 
faster than we would have if we weren't 
in that environment yeah and what do you 
like best about him 
um there's a lot of things but probably 
just like 
how 
good he is at dealing with conflict and 
like managing relationships wow 
he's always the person that I go to if I 
have a conflict with my mom or my sister 
or a friend 
um he always has like the best advice on 
how to 
deal with people and I think that 
translates to how he handles me 
um where like I can be a little bit 
crazy and inflexible 
um and he's able to be like the flexible 
one in our relationship and and is able 
to kind of mouth and and change 
small things to help me 
um 
and make me feel good so probably that 
and just like how loving and supportive 
he is like 
he is really a partner and like knows 
how important my career is to me knows 
how important my family is to me and as 
always just there to help support and 
make that 
um a priority for for both of us 
and I know we would often go back in and 
look at your marriage map contract and 
that list of people that make you happy 
and tick and tie and I would venture a 
guess he's now if we redid that exercise 
he would be the number one person on 
your happy list yeah with the same 
qualities and that's our Holy Grail 
right and so right you we knew uh you 
you hit the jackpot and so what happened 
now your relationship's expedited 
we know the spoiler alert we know the 
yes the relationship was pretty 
expedited I remember meeting his parents 
for the first time he met my parents for 
the first time and then I think my 
parents were very excited 
um because 
our dog hates strangers and she didn't 
bark when he walked into the door of the 
house he came in with presents for 
everybody including the dog 
um 
and amazing 
um they were very excited and soon after 
that they were like oh he needs to meet 
all of our friends and I was like can we 
just like slow it down a little bit of 
course not or South Asian yeah he was a 
good sport about that too because he 
loves meeting new people so I didn't 
have a problem with having to meet all 
of my parents close friends 
um and then yeah we got their blessing 
the parents blessing to move in together 
um and then so that was in September of 
2020 so yeah that was pretty fast 
um and then we ended up getting engaged 
in March of 2021 so like basically a 
year after later after we met 
um and then yeah we just got married in 
June and so yeah it's been six months I 
guess 
a little bit more than six months of 
marriage and now you have a dog yes and 
now we have a dog who is very cute 
um he's getting a little more 
rambunctious but he's he's very cute and 
we love him so 
absolutely 
if you look back to early 2020 right 
three years ago what would you you know 
would you have ever thought you'd be 
here 
no never like I was convinced like that 
I was never gonna find someone never did 
I ever think that I could meet someone 
and find like not only meet someone but 
like meet the person that I was gonna 
spend the rest of my life with 
um 
and yeah I like looking back on it now 
I'm still kind of shocked that I'm here 
three years later yeah wow I'm so happy 
for you you deserve all of it thank you 
I mean it's really thanks to you and 
thanks to Lindsay because as I said like 
I was 
failing at the dating game before I met 
you guys and yeah I mean my friends even 
say it like how 
my mindset was just like completely 
wrong and you guys helped me to see that 
that's mindset is really really 
important and I know that's something we 
focused on call after call like how do 
we look at this how do we look at dating 
how do we look at the relationship right 
how do we navigate the relationship and 
mindset and life is everything and I 
think you grew so much during our 
process and we could both feel it and 
see it yeah and now I'm like wanting you 
know to tell all my friends so like you 
can do this like I did it there's like a 
formula for it like call Bella and 
Lindsay because they can help you 
oh I'm so so glad I'm so glad that you 
found the perfect lid to your pot and 
you guys can look on our website and see 
how cute these two are because it's kind 
of ridiculous 
um how adorably lovely they are and 
again I couldn't be happier for you 
um do you have any parting advice you 
would give people that are on the fence 
or just kind of thing thinking it can't 
happen for them 
I guess parting advice would be like if 
you haven't had success you're probably 
doing it wrong so call Mel and Lindsay 
because they will help you 
um but no really I think like for people 
like me who have this like long list of 
qualities that they're looking for 
um 
most of those are not actually important 
um and so really identifying what Bella 
calls the happy list of people that make 
you feel good to be around and what what 
are the qualities that those people have 
I think was like the biggest thing that 
helped me change my mindset in terms of 
what I was looking for 
um like weepy here teary Goosebumps so 
thank you so so much for 
telling us Your Love Story it's 
um and thank you for keeping your 
promise way back when in the dating

when it's not an if start to do things 
differently like Anushka said there is 
no reason to sit around and stew in your 
juice if you aren't getting the progress 
you want it's like look at anything in 
your life if you're not in the right 
shape if you're not making progress at
