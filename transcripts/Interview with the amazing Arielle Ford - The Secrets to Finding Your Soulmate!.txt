arielle ford tell me it's a giant 
question in your definition what is love 
the most important thing to really begin 
to understand 
is that love is not a feeling and even 
if you end up with the most perfect soul 
mate in the universe there are days when 
you're going to hate them and it doesn't 
mean that you don't love them so coming 
to the understanding that real mature 
adult love is behavior is critical to 
the success 
of having a lot you know having a 
long-term happy committed partnership 
love is an action it is a decision it is 
a behavior it is not a feeling that 
feeling that hollywood and bollywood and 
harlequin and social media there should 
be love at first sight instant chemistry 
and she's telling you that is nature's 
way of tricking us into attachment
