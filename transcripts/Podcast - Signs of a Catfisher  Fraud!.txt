[Music] 
what Eileen and I are going to talk 
about is something that you have asked 
for and even when we give it to you you 
ask for it again and again and again 
what we want to talk to you today about 
is signs that you're talking to a 
catfish someone who's disingenuous a 
Tinder swindler a fraud somebody who's 
just plain unsavory I'm so relieved in a 
way that people ask for this again 
because it's so important there's always 
a new scam there's always a new spindle 
and sadly a lot of times because love is 
a strong emotion that makes us all do 
some crazy things it makes people Target 
and this is not just targeted to females 
guys if you're a guy listening to this 
we've had that many men also potentially 
get lured in by someone that is unsavory
