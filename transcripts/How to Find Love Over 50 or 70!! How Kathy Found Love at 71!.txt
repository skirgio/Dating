welcome to the Smart dating Academy 
podcast I'm Bella Grande the founder of 
Smart dating Academy and your host I

people dating advice that actually 
worked that I took I've been married for 
almost 25 years and now my company helps 
people to date smarter and to find love

into your life no matter where you are 
and what you do and we're here to bring 
more life into your love markdators 
welcome to this week's episode and this 
love story of my friend Kathy is going 
to I'm going to use a term that she just 
used in our pre-session kind of inspired 
the pants off of you not literally but 
I'm gonna tell you why because Kathy has 
found love and she's 71 years old and 
she lives in a place where you wouldn't 
think that that was the case Kathy came 
to us and she's going to tell you her 
story of how she found love at her age 
and I just want you all to hear her 
story because for those of you who need 
hope who need some psychotic optimism 
who tell yourselves man there's nobody 
left at my age or I'm too old all of 
those mind monkeys I'm bringing Kathy on 
here to dispel all of those Bad Monkey 
mind thoughts so Kathy welcome to the

Harvey Show years and years ago that's 
where I first saw you I have been 
stalking you ever since you didn't know 
that but I didn't I didn't I have been 
stalking you and listening to you and 
um you know little your words stuck with 
me

finally 
took the plunge and did the uh over 50 
love lab 
and that's when we actually met 
that's right we met Matt but I I have to 
tell you the funny or maybe it was yes 
so we met when you did our love lab 
Workshop dating after 50. and then you 
told me that I've been on your Instagram 
lives which yes most of you know I did 
Instagram lives religiously every 
Thursday during covid for I don't know 
almost two years but yeah and Kathy told

the funny thing is I do the same thing 
with my children and grandchildren so 
don't laugh too hard it happens to you 
oh my gosh and I love that that is 
hilarious my parents did that as well 
with Ravine and Bella so it was like 
rubella right so it's so funny so Kathy 
was a an OG member of the Instagram 
family chiming in did our dating over 50 
love lab and then tell us your story of 
you know what inspired you and I 
actually and I also want you to kind of 
maybe tell us your back story tell us 
you how you grew up getting married what 
happened and how you ended up at that 
love lab 
um well I um met my husband uh at a bar 
the good old-fashioned way the good 
old-fashioned way that's what you did it 
back then and uh he saved me from some 
drunk actually and I thought oh my 
knight in shining armor and uh we dated 
we dated for two years got married 
because that was the thing you did you 
know yeah 
you know that was my background I grew 
up in a um uh an Italian I'm a battalion 
descent and family and married and kids 
and and I did all that and 
um 
fast forward 
um you know we were going to retire we 
had the kids we had a retirement house 
and 
um he had retired early from his one job 
but was too young and so he took another 
job but that required travel got it and 
so he would go back and forth uh between 
east coast and we had a place in the 
Southwest 
and uh 
the things were got kind of Rocky you 
know but it was I thought 
like any point in your marriage you're 
gonna work it out things will work out 
and I I thought they would and 
um 
I decided I was it was Mother's Day and 
I thought he's not coming home I'm gonna 
go surprise him 
and I knocked on the door 
and she answered 
and I found out 
he had been living with her for almost 
two years 
and I say that and when I say that 
people go you didn't know 
I didn't have a clue I wasn't thinking 
like that when I think back were there 
Clues yeah there were but I wasn't 
thinking like that 
um 
I was a I was a stay-at-home mom I 
didn't have a career that was my career 
my husband my children was my career so 
when he left 
um 
I was left with nothing 
wow um I have Goosebumps I was like 
actually he left I he left it was just 
before the holidays and I had four 
hundred dollars 
that was it 
that was all I had 
it's gonna make me oh my God I have 
Goosebumps I have 400 I had to borrow 
money it's gonna make me kind of I had 
to borrow money from my daughter to hire 
a divorce attorney 
it was very humbling 
um 
to say he cut me off at my knees 
is an understatement 
but I will say 
um 
what I told him is that if you think I'm 
going to curl up in a corner and die 
it ain't happening and it didn't I can't 
tell you it was easy 
it wasn't it took years and years 
but here I am 
and I do believe you go and and when it 
happened a friend of mine said this is 
going to be the hardest thing you'll 
ever do 
you're not going to be the same person 
you'll get through it but you're not 
going to be the same person and she was 
right you're not the same person 
uh I think I'm a better person 
and I think it happens you know I I 
think there's a plan for you I I think 
um 
I think I needed to be a better person I 
I would have preferred to have done it a 
different way right yes you know and I 
lost a lot I lost I lost my family 
I didn't just lose my husband I lost my 
son 
so 
I have lost 
my holidays are not the same 
uh birthdays it just all changed for me 
and I had to change my perspective 
and it wasn't an easy thing to do it 
never is 
but you do what you have to do and you 
go on you and and I felt I wasn't uh I 
felt I needed to be a role model for my 
grandchildren and for my daughter that 
life can't you never know what life is 
going to hand you 
but 
you pick yourself up and you get through 
it you do what you have to do 
and I really felt I needed to do that I 
had to show them that you you don't let 
life get you down you're better than 
that you're stronger than that 
um 
wasn't easy but again here I am 
um and 
um 
I'm in a much better place I'm happier I 
didn't realize how unhappy I was 
and I can't blame 
my ex 
completely because it takes two 
you know it takes two I made mistakes as 
well 
um and you have to own up to that you 
can't just point the finger you have to 
own up to that it takes two but um 
foreign 
here I am and life is great here you are 
and yes you know I love hearing these 
love stories even though we've worked 
together for so long because there are 
things that always come out in these 
conversations and and I don't know that 
I knew that you had four hundred dollars 
and how you know how low the low really 
was which is sort of amazing because you 
know it you know they always say things 
can always be worse and things could 
have been worse they could have yeah but 
that's pretty bad and to see you bright 
shiny and hear telling your story 
um tell us what now Flash Forward what 
year were what year was it that you got 
divorced and and then flash us forward 
to last year oh geez it's been 
um 
it's been about nine years we've 
separated 
um you know the good Catholic you know 
you don't you don't get divorced and so 
I thought well separation and 
it just you know I kept getting taken 
back to court and it's like you know 
what 
I need to sever this I just need to move 
on yeah and uh so I you know I was kind 
of dating for 
probably a good nine years and and 
thought what am I getting wrong 
I mean I would always do my hair I 
always had makeup on I always had ear I 
never went to the grocery store with 
that looking good 
people seem to like me and yet I would 
go on dates and I'd the longest 
relationship I was ever in was a year 
and 
he was a great guy he just wasn't God 
for me I couldn't 
I I just couldn't seem to connect 
with the kind of man I really wanted 
and I thought 
um 
I I got to be 70. and you know in life 
how you hit milestones and you sort of 
sit back and take a stock totally those 
zero birthdays are a big deal oh my gosh 
oh my goodness oh my goodness I and you 
know Bella I still don't know how my 
name and that number got to be in the 
same sentence I still don't understand 
that because you don't look anything 
whatever you imagine 70 to look like you 
just need to take a look at the photos 
that are on our site of this gorgeous 
woman but I I I I stand that she's 
amazing she's hashtag goals for 71. I 
want to be well 
oh yeah yeah I thank my mother for that 
um anyway I 70 I kind of took stock and 
thought 
what do I have left here 
10 maybe 15 good years 
you know I'm talking good that you're 
healthy and you could travel and so 
anything beyond that is a bonus 
and so I thought 
you know listening to Bella and thought 
you know what I am going to invest in 
myself 
and I thought this is my last shot if I 
can't do it now then I guess my ex maybe 
he's right maybe I'm not so lovable 
and maybe this is how 
I live my life I live my life alone I 
didn't want to but I thought well but I 
was gonna give it a shot 
and a year ago 
and in fact I saw you had posted 
somebody had just had their photo shoot 
and I thought that was me I had my photo 
shoot October I think it was the fifth 
yeah fourth and fifth I think it was 
October 5th last year 
I thought that was me one year ago 
and how my life has changed in one year 
I never would have believed it never I 
still don't believe it I I I'm 
I'm amazed I'm amazed anyway I did the 
photo shoot I kept putting it off I 
don't know like I lose 30 pounds I get 
it a million excuses and you and I mean 
kept saying no do it do the shoot do the 
photos wait what are you waiting for 
what are you waiting for 
and then even after the photo shoot I 
kept no no no I can't I can't I kept 
and then I thought 
what am I waiting for 
what am I waiting for tick tock tick 
tock you know 
and I did it and my problem was where I 
lived 
there was nobody around I lived in this 
little town and it was a distance from 
everything 
and you kept saying they'll come and I 
do also remember Steve Harvey way back 
saying if a man likes you if a man wants 
you he will go across the country 
to see you and I have it in the back of 
my mind and when I did uh join uh join 
Smart dating Academy I had that sliver 
of Hope in the back of my mind I I I was 
pretending to be psychotic psychotically 
optimistic for you you did it you had me 
at hello 
but I did have my doubts but I hung in 
there and you know you don't want to 
join you don't want to get online 
because there's that rejection and 
there's oh to go through it all 
but I did everything you said 
um I I I 
followed you sent that makeup video 
I changed my makeup I tweaked it because 
I always wore makeup I always did my 
hair I always I always dressed up 
um but I tweaked things and we were 
picking out outfits for the photo shoot 
oh my God and I remember I had this 
outfit on and you said to me that is 
really cute but I have a question 
are you going out with your girlfriends 
or are you going on a date with a man 
did I really say that too it sounds very 
much like me well you did and I thought 
you're right I I got it as soon as you 
said that I got it and you kept saying 
show your curves men want to see what 
they're getting show those curves she's 
curvy and gorgeous oh my gosh well I 
didn't feel like it at the time you know 
uh 30 pounds 40 pounds heavier I sure 
didn't feel like it but I did what you 
said the point is I listened to you I 
did what you said I got those career 
clothes in fact in fact if you remember 
when I had the photo shoot I said to you 
can we Photoshop these pictures 
and you said no we don't do that no no 
we do not Photoshop but Smart dating 
Academy no no the First Act of 
self-sabotage right first of all she's 
beautiful and probably like you dear 
listener you think ugh I'm too heavy I'm 
too old and we see through all of that 
and we see the beauty in you we 
certainly saw the beauty in Kathy who 
thought she needed to be photoshopped 
anybody listening to this you don't need 
to be photoshopped maybe a couple of 
tweaks here and there get your Berry lip 
on get some clothes yes you look like 
you love yourself you're going on a date 
and when we talk about curves we're not 
talking about we want you to look 
hoochie hot mama 
we are pretty we are sophisticated we 
are elegant at Smart dating yes exactly 
and I still remember that you know it's 
when I go out it's wait a minute who am 
I going out with Ruben or am I and where 
am I going here so I remember those you 
you I like you shoot from the hip and I 
like it 
it kind of sticks with me yeah so right 
right anyway so I did that and you know 
there were 
when you get older 
dating is different I I say dating and 
when you're 60 and your 70s is different 
than when you're in your 60s I don't 
know where it makes the change 
but it does 
um I I jokingly say I date in dog years 
because it's it's kind of accelerated 
it's it's sort of 
I don't think you you don't you still 
don't know exactly what you want you 
think you do but really not but you're 
very clear at least for me very clear on 
what I didn't want yeah you know 
everybody wants the tall handsome 
worldly 
successful and you think the package is 
what you want 
and it's not necessarily that 
and you guys taught me 
expanded a little bit just just a little 
bit and I did that I listened to 
everything not only listened I did 
everything you said to do 
and Eileen was my coach and Eileen 
sweet patient Eileen everybody loves 
Eileen yes yes yes and she um guided me 
through you know do this do that anyway 
fast forward 
um in January the one thing I did do uh 
is video dating I did do the video and 
that I cannot recommend that enough it 
is a game changer 
it really you know you 
um 
you you send text and email and the 
written word can be misinterpreted I and 
I find when I speak with someone you get 
a different sense of them when you do 
video 
it's even better 
because you see them in 3D and it's like 
oh yeah I can see how they look like 
that picture I can it's a better sense 
of them 
and 
um I did that and it really 
um eliminated a lot of these older men 
oh my goodness oh I don't know how I 
gotta have my son show me I had a 
migraine and I would say it's not that 
hard I'm not tech savvy I can walk you 
through it and I thought you know what 
if you don't even want to put in the 
effort 
you're done and so it eliminated a lot 
of people for me 
um 
so that that part was good 
anyway Along Comes Reuben 
and I what I did is 
um I tweaked my age 
um the I was going for 
older I was going I think for 70 to 76 
or something like that well 
you know some of these older men I swear 
I could hear the feet Shuffle you know 
that old man feet Shuffle I swear I 
could hear it 
no no no no or they'd say you know I had 
a stroke but I'm doing really good oh 
man or 
um you know one guy I even had oh my 
goodness one guy had to have his teeth 
he had his teeth taken out 
but he got on a video with me 
with no teeth 
oh my God aren't you glad you did the 
video right oh my goodness oh my 
goodness can you imagine that it's like 
this is your best foot forward oh no oh 
no no no 
anyway so I tweaked it to a little bit 
younger 
and uh 
there was Reuben 
and uh Reuben's about a year and a half 
younger than I am 
uh he's still in his 60s and he reminds 
me of that I I do have to say 
wait he um got online and you and Eileen 
kept saying somebody will because I kept 
saying distance is a problem nobody 
wants to travel nobody wants to travel 
I'm a couple hours away 
and that was the story you were telling 
yourself from day one there are no 
people I there's no people around here 
and no age-appropriate people and and so 
you started to see even before Reuben 
you were getting once you improve your 
photos you improve your profile you have 
someone helping you you started to build 
a funnel and yes sometimes I have 55 
year olds telling me I'm too old for 
this there's no good men my age I'm like 
oh my gosh there are so many good people 
out there we just have to do a bunch of 
things right so you started to see this 
funnel of people in your state 
I did and you know what changed too is 
the type of person because before it was 
um oh I like hunting and I like and it's 
like oh Lord 
um you know I'm hunting and I like 
and I don't mean I like hunting I like 
fishing I like I live in my RV and it's 
like that's all good but that's not me 
but that's just not me 
um 
not that I haven't done that but it's 
just not me it's it's not what I what I 
wanted for my classy gal well I don't I 
anyway but and I was Finding different 
men I I was Finding different men 
um and distance still was a problem it 
was and it eliminated some of the men 
um which was okay because you know what 
if I'm not worth the trip 
then goodbye you know then uh then then 
you don't get the privilege absolutely 
anyway Along Comes Reuben and uh Reuben 
had this 
you know kind of text back and forth and 
I learned don't you text back and forth 
just a couple of times then and it was 
hey do you want to do a video 
and Reuben was 
something new yeah let's try it and 
before I could even explain to him how 
to do it he did it he he did it he 
called me 
and I thought I like that he was 
open to new things he just had an energy 
about him that I really liked 
and so we started doing these videos 
this video dating and we did that 
several times a week and I know Lindsay 
always said don't do more than 20 
minutes 20 minutes and be done don't do 
well Reuben and I would talk never less 
than two hours the time just flew by 
what I did do 
um is like I don't know if you know uh 
Arthur Aaron have you heard yeah the 
questions the 36 questions 
Reuben and I did the 36 questions 
and it really created such conversation 
and we really got to know one another 
so that when we met and we had we did 
videotape we did 
um we would have wine you know let's 
let's have some wine and and you know 
and appetizers and we would have dinner 
remember Lindsay saying that we would 
have dinner we so we we just had fun 
dates and this is before you ever met in 
person all of this was happening in 
person you did and for those if you're 
listening and you don't know who Arthur 
Aaron is it's a-r-o-n and he is very 
famous for saying if you ask these 36 
questions of a romantic partner and then 
stare into each other's eyes for five 
minutes you know and there's a series I 
can I'll post the questions in the show 
notes but it's really interesting and 
it's amazing that you did that before 
you met for the first time it's amazing 
that you've suggested it and that he did 
it I love how he showed you like you're 
saying this desire for growth change and 
development I will vibe check you I'll 
call you something new yeah let's do the 
question now let's have wine and 
appetizers and it was I'm gonna use my 
favorite word in relationships easy it 
was he yes he was he is easy 
he is and he was he's open to new things 
when I suggested because if he didn't 
want to do the questions I wouldn't have 
done it sure but it got you know it's 
funny as I said before you know I hadn't 
dated in what 40 42 years and when I was 
dating then you go to a bar and the 
question was what's your sign 
well as you get older the question then 
becomes are those your teeth you know it 
changes itself 
[Laughter] 
hey baby are those your teeth 
oh I'm a Pisces by the way but yeah 
exactly exactly oh my God anyway 
um so we did these questions 
and you really 
you kind of know the person 
you you learn their values you learn 
um their core you learn who they really 
are 
so by the time we met and it was about 
we did it for about three weeks 
so by the time we met 
we knew each other it was different from 
any other date that I was on 
and uh Reuben showed up 
and he had a dozen roses a dozen yellow 
roses for me oh because that was 
friendship and he said you know I'm 
giving you yellow roses they signify 
friendship and I'm hoping they change 
and every time I saw him I got roses 
and as our dates change and he would 
come and and he and he said oh you're 
only two and a half hours away that's 
nothing 
oh did you guys hear did you hear that 
he was two and a half hours away in a 
rural Southwestern State so two and a 
half it can take me two and a half hours 
to get from the north side of the south 
side of Chicago on a Friday afternoon 
when the when the Cubs are playing so 
here two and a half hours how many miles 
is that oh my gosh that was like 300 he 
I mean he was in a different state 
he came from a different state two and 
he went oh too many Affairs that's 
nothing and I thought 
Bella and Eileen were right 
Steve Harvey 
they were right it was like oh that's 
nothing and he would come and every time 
he came 
I got roses to this day 
I get roses every week 
oh yeah they're red although although 
um 
this is a kind of a side thing I had 
said to him you know my favorite color 
my favorite flowers are really white I 
love white flowers 
and I get white roses now 
there are always fresh flowers in the 
house always to this day anyway 
um 
so Reuben comes and we 
we just hit it off I mean he just 
it was like we knew each other it was so 
he's easy he's just easy 
um 
I I I and I guess what I really want to 
say when you asked you know to do the 
podcast I guess when I started there 
wasn't anybody out there my age there 
were women 
um in their maybe late 50s early 60s but 
there wasn't anybody 
in their 70s and it's really different 
in your 70s it really is 
um even 70 to 75 oh my goodness the 
difference in men is like 
oh my goodness oh my goodness 
um and and I wish that there was 
somebody out there 
so I guess I'm out here to say 
don't give up 
there there's a lid for your pop there 
is a lid for your pot you just listen to 
Bella she knows what she's doing just 
listen just just 
um it works it works and I I didn't 
change myself overnight I didn't like I 
said I've always done my hair I was 
wearing jewelry I've always dressed like 
dress up to go to the grocery store I 
tweaked myself 
I put my best so far I was missing I 
couldn't figure out what I was doing 
wrong 
and um Bella and Eileen showed me so 
listen it works it really works 
um get your funnel 
uh do their tricks do the video dating 
it's um it is a game changer 
have a good mindset tweet believe it 
just new photos get the the photos oh my 
oh my God what a difference that made 
what a difference that made 
um just those little things 
here I am here I am a year later uh 
Reuben and I are together 
uh he asked me a couple months ago to 
move in with him I feel like I feel like 
this has gone you know some people have 
said don't you think you're going too 
fast and again I say well first of all 
we're dating in dog years so there is 
that tick tock 
um but also it's um 
I think you know 
I think for by four six months you kind 
of know 
you know and he asked me a couple months 
ago uh to move in with him 
and he is so sweet he asked my daughter 
for her blessing 
oh my God I'm full Goosebumps wow wow 
wow I mean how and and 
you guys dated granted we dated in dog 
years but yes we did but you followed 
the rules and even when there were 
speed bumps you could navigate through 
those speeds yes which happen at any age 
you had a surgery what happened what 
happened well I had I had to have my hip 
replaced and 
um you know and I had said listen you 
know what you need to back away you know 
stay away for six weeks you need to just 
um I I think I I was pushing him away 
and I kept doing it and he kept saying 
no I want to be there and finally he 
said to me you know you're not letting 
me you're not allowing me to be your 
partner I want to be your partner and 
you're not allowing me 
and that really took me back because I 
thought he's right 
he he's you get the good the bad the 
ugly 
that's 
you know that's the reality of a 
relationship 
and the funny thing about it was okay 
fine you do it and and he was there he 
would he would be there during the week 
he would leave on the weekend to go to 
his house and you know he got to 
maintain it 
it was in the summer and what happened 
is it actually Drew us closer 
because I mean physically I couldn't I 
was kind of homebound 
so we had to sit there and we had to 
talk and we had to have conversation and 
we got to know each other even better 
so 
um 
it's kind of funny the thing you fear 
the most 
can actually be to your benefit 
and uh yeah I I kept pushing him away 
and nope he nope wasn't going to do it 
wasn't gonna happen 
and he didn't he's been there every step 
of the way 
the good thing about Reuben is he's 
taught me 
how a relationship should really be 
I mean we have our disagreements we have 
our arguments it's not perfect 
I am but that's a different story 
I can vouch for your profession yeah 
yeah yeah but the thing with him and and 
he taught me I didn't know 
you could disagree 
without it being this full-blown 
argument and when you have the 
conversation 
and you resolve it 
it's gone 
it's it's just gone and I never knew 
that's what you did 
I just 
um before when you had a disagreement it 
was always such a full-blown argument I 
would try to avoid it 
that doesn't work 
that doesn't work with Reuben if we have 
you know we something happens that we 
don't like it I mean just the other day 
we had a disagreement 
but we sit down and say you know I don't 
like that you did that I don't like how 
you said it I don't okay all right and 
we resolve it and then we move on 
so he has taught me that we also 
um we're committed to make this work he 
was in a 32-year marriage I was in a 
four-year marriage 
and uh so we we want a relation we don't 
want to go through that again 
and we are do we go to classes 
we go to classes too every Tuesday night 
we go uh how to be how to be in a bit 
how to be a better partner 
I think we're the only ones that aren't 
married in this whole thing we're the 
oldest ones I think and the only ones 
not married but 
um we have the experience to know what 
not to do we may not 
know everything to do but we're 
committed to make this work and 
um I'm amazed that I was able to find a 
man like Ruben I have been looking 
for a man like him 
for what 10 years now 
and 
I did what you I kept missing I kept 
missing the mark 
and thanks to you 
I did it I found it I found him and he's 
not in the package that I thought he 
would be you know you want tall and dark 
well I'm 5'4 so you know even five six 
is tall for me 
Reuben's taller and you know I was 
always looking for um you know someone 
tall and who would protect me and you 
know this big guy 
Reuben isn't bad I mean he's just 
average you know he's he's trim he's in 
shape he's 5 10. and yet I feel very 
secure and protected with him he's not 
the package that I would have thought 
I wanted 
and yet he is the one 
and you guys taught me that expand your 
horizons just expand it just tweak it 
just that little bit and the funny thing 
is he did the same thing 
is he was looking 
for he he wasn't he didn't have 70. he 
had 60s in his and he tweaked his to 
include 70 and there I popped wow and 
actually he was the one that contacted 
me 
and I won't ever let him forget that 
absolutely it's like 
yes but had he not 
he not had I 
lowered my age 
we would not have crossed we may not 
have crossed paths 
so it's those those little things do 
matter 
100 yes yes and we were so fortunate 
number one to be able to help guide this 
relationship along and 
there are people that have no red flags 
like Reuben you didn't have butterflies 
in your stomach right there weren't I 
anger and stonewalling and even though 
we date in dog years it's not too fast 
and furious and even though he gave you 
flowers every week that's not love 
bombing this is someone who showed up 
and wanted to do something nice for you 
yes was seeking love and seeking love 
with you and something you told me in a 
conversation recently is that touched my 
heart and I wanted to touch yours dear 
listener is you said Reuben makes me 
feel so good about myself and he makes 
me feel smart yes yes you know we're 
involved in different things he's he's 
on a board and things come up and 
in my past in my marriage 
I was made to my my opinion 
I wasn't smart enough I wasn't 
uh you know I wasn't 
worthy of having an opinion when Reuben 
seeks me out what do you think 
what would you know who how what do you 
think of this or he'll he asked my 
opinion we have conversation 
and and I hear him talk to other people 
and he'll say oh Kathy is so smart Kathy 
this or cat wait till you meet Kathy you 
you will love her 
and I hear him say this and I think 
wow he 
I I haven't you know I I didn't realize 
in my marriage 
I wasn't hit I wasn't abused in that way 
but I was made to feel small I was made 
to feel less than I didn't matter 
and I didn't realize it you know you 
learned to shrink 
and I don't have to shrink with Ruben 
I don't I could be 
and that is one thing uh after the 
marriage that in therapy and you know if 
I you know therapy helped too is I 
learned 
I got my voice 
and that was one thing I was not going 
to give up I found my voice and Reuben 
allows me 
to have my voice 
and he makes me a better person he he 
really does uh we're good for each other 
we have each other's backs we um 
you know it's 
you know we have you know the children 
you you would think adult children would 
never be a problem oh my goodness boy oh 
my goodness they can be it's it really 
is difficult and uh you know reuben 
reuben has my back if you don't include 
Kathy then then you don't want me 
and yeah so he's and we're there for 
each other 
and I didn't think I would ever find 
this I didn't think it was there I 
thought really when I thought Steve 
Harvey and you guys saying oh people 
will travel I thought 
that's for the younger people people 
with a career people 
professional people I was a stay-at-home 
mom I didn't 
that wasn't me 
yeah you meant me 
oh you got to believe it it's there you 
just have to keep you just keep plugging 
away you just you get the rejection and 
you just 
pick yourself up and you go on to the 
next one say okay fine then then you 
know what you you have to change your 
way of thinking you don't have to you 
don't look at it that they don't I'm not 
good enough for them you have to think 
they did you a favor 
they did you a favor by eliminating them 
themselves exactly exactly change your 
perspective 
you know one of the things I know when 
we worked with you and on your marriage 
map contract because you're one of our 
one-on-one clients I put this phrase in 
saying I want him to like you just a 
little bit more yes like him like you're 
51 and he's 49 and what you're saying is 
exactly right that if they choose to not 
message you or eliminate you well they 
didn't hit our rubric so goodbye to you 
that's right right that's right they did 
me a favor they did me a favor bless and 
release bless and release exactly 
exactly exactly you know it's still you 
know it gets sometimes they're hard hits 
yeah but 
you know it's life 
that's life and years that's life yeah 
and you are so different right like you 
said you emerged from your divorce a 
difference oh my goodness 
and you emerged through dating as a 
different person oh my goodness oh my 
goodness 
you know I I also jokingly say there's a 
lot of frogs out there a lot of frogs 
before you find your prince but he's out 
there 
he is out there and what would you tell 
people that think I'm too old I'm in my 
50s my 60s my 70s what would you tell 
them 
I would tell them believe he's out there 
he or she they're out there you just you 
just have to keep keep the faith as they 
said back in the day keep the faith baby 
keep the faith you have to believe 
that you're worthy because you are 
you are you are lovable there it you're 
just not finding the person it doesn't 
mean it has nothing to do with you 
you just haven't found the person 
and 
um you know maybe you need to tweak 
things and and maybe you need the 
professionals to come in you do it for 
everything else 
so why not for that if you go to the 
makeup counter and yeah tell the girl do 
my makeup because I want to look better 
well how is this different 
yeah I I I'm I'm missing the mark on 
dating help me what am I doing wrong 
coach me yeah you know so 
uh do what you have to do but they're 
out there 
and you just 
you know you don't get the brass ring 
every time you go around the 
Merry-Go-Round sometimes you have to go 
around a few times but you get it 
and you keep trying you keep putting 
yourself out there and um it's not easy 
and as you get older I will say it's um 
I don't want to say slim pickings but 
it's different different it is different 
it it is different and um and I don't 
know when it happens I don't know when 
that transition happens but it does 
happen 
and um you know like anything in life 
you just make those side steps then 
you just move along 
and love will come to you it always does 
it takes time for some of our clients 
it's taken three four five six years for 
some 
lucky people when the universe also says 
it's your time he entered your doorstep 
you know halfway through the process and 
for that there's Powers beyond all of us 
that yes that to happen and so you know 
the universe said Kathy you've got to do 
a couple things and you knew to take 
actions you knew I'm gonna change things 
I'm going to do this love lab I'm going 
to get some coaching around there and 
you listened to that voice inside of you 
because I wouldn't have known and Eileen 
wouldn't have known and you wouldn't 
have known that two and a half hours 
away hundreds of miles away across the 
state line was the lid to your pot and 
yes and I have I've had goosebumps 
literally I'm gonna have to have like 
some hot cocoa after this because 
everything we're talking about has given 
me goosebumps you've inspired me thank

you are my friend if you're in your 30s 
40s 50s 60s 70s you feel like Kathy felt 
you feel like when there's a zero that 
gets put at the end of your age things 
are going to change the pickings are 
going to get Slimmer I hear this from 
people that turn 30 40 50 60 and 70.
