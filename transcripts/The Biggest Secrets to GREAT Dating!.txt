today I have someone amazing for you and 
this someone isn't just to someone this 
is someone who's part of the heartbeat 
of Smart dating Academy she's helped 
develop the curriculum that has coached 
you Lindsay thank you for finally 
finally putting some time on the 
calendar to do this because I couldn't 
be more excited to have you here oh 
fella so sweet you know people ask me 
Bella how do you bring people onto your 
own staff I'm like well it's a pretty 
high bar I really always felt that my 
heart was helping put people together 
but I definitely observed some patterns 
over the years as a Matchmaker which is 
that when people come to see you they 
have a very clear criteria of what they 
think they need in a relationship and it 
is a checklist and sometimes we're able 
to get that lined up and teach people 
and they get everything they want on the 
list but they don't necessarily they 
never felt fulfilled
