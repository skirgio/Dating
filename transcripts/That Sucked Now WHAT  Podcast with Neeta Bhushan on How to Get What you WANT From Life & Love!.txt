my friend Nita wrote an amazing book 
called wait for it that sucked now what 
which is like the perfect title to 
Nita's life tell us about the suck that 
has happened to you for the last 20 
years of your life and where you are now 
so I thought I had this like 
picture-perfect marriage and this 
picture-perfect dream you know home life 
that I had built and December 31st 2011 
was brought down to my knees and I was 
looking in the mirror I finally saw 
myself that I was living this lie why 
that day neither that was the last time 
I would let him hit me in the face and 
now you get to choose but in order to 
choose we've got to take the risks and 
we've got to say yes to get out of the 
suck
