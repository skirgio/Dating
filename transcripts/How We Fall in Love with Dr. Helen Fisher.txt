even though you know this is bad for you 
you still go back for more and I've done 
it myself and I said don't call him 
Helen as I'm punching those buttons my 
twin sister was madly in love with a guy 
for 10 years he dumped her she looks 
back at it now and says thank God and 
she went out with other men and 
everything but he was always really in 
her heart and the beauty of it Bella is 
when you finally reach 
indifference no longer you know you 
don't care anymore I mean you might like 
the but you certainly remember them you 
know uh I mean I've studied rejection 
and put people in the scanner and the me 
you don't kill the memory of it but you 
kill the feeling the craving the drive 
the obsession that goes with that 
memory
