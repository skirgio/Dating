the holidays are an amazing time but 
they can also be a time where we can 
start to feel lonely we can start to 
feel sad and it's incredibly normal what 
I want to talk to you about today is how 
do you put yourself into a better State 
of Mind dare I say how do you become 
psychotically optimistic about your 
dating life and your love life I want 
you today to take all of the tips that 
I'm going to give you about how to 
become a psychotic optimist about your 
life and imbibe them and if you do these 
things I promise you it takes some work 
as all big things in life do but as you 
start to do these things and 
systematically bring them into your life 
you will feel better about yourself and 
you will feel better about your life
