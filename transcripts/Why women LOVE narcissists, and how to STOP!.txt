seen how trauma and betrayal can 
immobilize even the most capable and 
insightful women so Michelle welcome to 
the Smart dating Academy podcast we 
cannot wait for the gems that I know you 
were just going to launch on us thank 
you Bella it's so nice to see you again 
to be back here it's so awesome so 
Michelle tell us about just kind of a 
summary of 
your background the research you did and 
what cptsd is because your work blew my 
mind the first time I heard it 
yeah okay well 
um I first started my career as a 
journalist 
um my gosh long time ago now 30 years 
ago and 
um I covered crime so as you can imagine 
um I saw a lot of dark personalities and 
um 
I was always really curious and 
fascinated about that and then I also 
got to kind of observe the collateral 
damage of that so kind of the seeds for 
this interest were planted 
way back then 
um when I left journalism about a decade 
ago it was just kind of as this kind of 
Boom of narcissism was starting to 
percolate on social media 
um there wasn't much happening kind of 
in the mainstream press or 
um psychological journals at the time 
but there were there was a big group of 
survivors who couldn't figure out what 
was happening to them 
um they they were traumatized they were 
um they were kind of brought to their 
knees by these relationships that were 
driving them crazy but they really 
didn't even know why or if they were 
being abused and this whole kind of 
field of narcissistic abuse started to 
grow and percolate in 
um in Facebook groups and on Instagram 
pages and this is what started about a 
decade ago and I had some personal 
experience with narcissism in my my 
family of origin and in a relationship 
that I had and I was interested in it 
too 
so I just kind of watched and observed 
as this scene kind of started to take 
root and then when I got into my own 
psychology and counseling studies I 
decided to take this on full time 
that's awesome so so cool and and tell 
me tell us about 
what you discovered about Early 
Childhood experiences the the the the 
test so to speak that blew my mind the 
first time we talked and what c as in 
Captain cptsd is oh yeah thank you so of 
course the internet abounded and all 
these opinions about the topic of 
narcissism and they weren't always 
helpful and there was little published 
science in it what there was mainly 
looked at what made a pathologically 
narcissistic man my research um was is 
the first 
peer-reviewed extensive research that 
focuses on survivors wow 
women who identify as narcissistic abuse 
survivors and what I learned about them 
was that they scored four times higher 
for the presence of childhood early life 
trauma than the average population 
that's very significant I have 
Goosebumps listening to that like full 
body chills listening to that yeah and 
you nearly three out of four of them 
then met the clinical criteria the 
cutoff scores for what is known as 
complex 
um 
PTSD complex post-traumatic stress 
disorder 
this is a form of PTSD that happens when 
a person gets trapped in the situation 
it it is diagnosed in for prisoners of 
War domestic violence victims child 
abuse victims it's when you can't escape 
the abuse and it is one of the hardest 
um 
uh diagnoses to identify and treat 
and what I learned was that 
three out of four so almost 75 of the 2 
000 women who participated in my study 
met the diagnostic criteria for cptsd 
but almost none of them had been 
diagnosed 
unbelievable so they identified as 
victims of narcissistic abuse but had no 
idea three out of four that they had 
experienced 
diagnosable 
cptsd because of Early Childhood 
experiences or relationships well I'm 
not sure if they didn't have any idea 
but the people that they were depending 
on to treat them weren't seeing the 
connection which is the more important 
part right 
um complex PTSD is a relatively new 
diagnosis 
um it's an important one because we even 
treat it differently from PTSD there's 
in um 
so the a lot of the treatment protocols 
that we use are even slightly different 
for complex PTSD versus regular PTSD but 
these this group of women were having 
really serious 
cptsd symptoms but no one in the 
clinical Community was diagnosing it for 
what it was wow and that's what my 
research showed 
um so the clinical implications for this 
are are incredible and it also showed um 
just how underserved this group of women 
were 
another step that I took because I 
really wanted to know okay well what's 
causing the cptsd was it just the early 
childhood abuse or was it the 
narcissistic abuse so we did um we did a 
statistical 
analysis called a multiple regression 
analysis and we determined that it was 
both 
cptsd would would be present 
statistically 
um with just the childhood 
um trauma but as well as the 
narcissistic abuse so it wasn't one or 
the other it was both and so we couldn't 
explain it away the narcissistic abuse 
was damaging and so was the early life 
trauma 
so can you did your study show 
correlation between people that had 
Early Childhood trauma and people that 
would accept the narcissistic abuse and 
except isn't a good word so people that 
underwent you know trauma early on were 
more likely to to say I guess this is 
okay I guess this is what love feels 
like I guess this is what relationships 
feel like 
yeah and here's and you know and here's 
the difference between kind of getting 
your information off the internet and 
working with a trauma specialist okay 
what we know I'm largely from 
um the body keeps the score and um Dr 
um Bessel vanderkolk's work is that 
um survivors of trauma carry a different 
physiology in their body after trauma 
occurs 
um 
so trauma reenactment Theory which is 
Vander cult's Theory maintains that this 
subconscious attraction to familiar 
trauma whether they're experienced as a 
child or adult or both it's repeated on 
behavioral emotional 
physiological and neuroendocrine levels 
so this isn't just something that you 
choose this is really something that is 
in your nervous system so it's it's 
almost and for many people it's there 
might be a fleeting awareness of it 
but it is so much deeper than that which 
is why a really high level of 
intervention is needed to kind of 
interrupt these Cycles 
so there's a lot of just like with 
regular domestic violence there's just a 
lot of victim blaming involved in that 
right because we're shocked there's 
there's almost uh you know there's 
there's this trauma bonding that happens 
and that looks a lot like kind of an 
addiction to this type of relationship 
and I guess on one level that's true but 
it's it's not um something that she is 
choosing 
it is um it's repetition compulsion of 
trauma 
wow mind-blowing and 
how does one get diagnosed you mentioned 
that it's often missed in the clinical 
Community how do how does one get 
diagnosed with cptsd 
so you would you would go to a therapist 
and you would work with them and there 
there is um clinical criteria 
um for complex 
post-traumatic stress disorder 
on how we measured it in my study was 
the complex trauma inventory which is a 
new measure 
and what it it does is it measures all 
of the criteria for regular PTSD plus 
emotion dysregulation 
um and 
it adds those two scores together to get 
a complex trauma 
um measure so you could take 
um a you could take a measure like that 
to get some sort of idea if you had that 
um but also I'm working with a clinician 
a really trained skilled trauma 
therapist 
um 
they could render a diagnosis 
that's great so okay so there's some you 
and and I know if you're listening in 
this if this is resonant to you you 
might be thinking oh my God my therapist 
has never said this what do I need to do 
and this is why I'm probing for this a 
little bit and if you find yourself in 
that situation then what Dr Roberts is 
referring to is finding somebody who is 
trained in a specific way that is a 
trauma therapist is that right yes yes 
so and there's very few clinicians 
really working in this space this 
overlap of narcissistic abuse or we 
could even call it the coercive control 
component of domestic violence 
um so there there aren't many of us out 
there 
um but I'm finding anyone who's really 
skilled in trauma therapy so 
um an EMDR therapist eye movement 
desensitization reprocessing therapist 
or someone who says that they do ifs 
therapy or attachment work these are the 
things that you want to listen for or 
read when you're looking for someone 
so 
um another one somatic experiencing if a 
therapist knows that kind of modality 
chances are good that he or she is going 
to kind of be skilled enough in this 
area to get you where you need to go 
wow and it sounds like people can heal 
from this and and and 
cope as much as one can with the the 
hands that have been dealt to them but 
it sounds like there's some really 
exciting things that can be done to make 
life better 
yes 
um I would say that's very very true 
um 
I wanted to say you know there's so much 
out there right now about narcissism and 
narcissistic abuse and is it really as 
pervasive as it seems and 
I mean statistically 
um I would say yes I mean we've got 
studies out now a meta-analysis that 
shows that American college students 
today are 40 less empathetic than 30 
years ago 
with the numbers primarily dropping 
after 2000. 
more specifically today's students 
scored 48 percent lower an empathetic 
concern and 34 percent lower in 
perspective taking both of which are 
really important indices of empathy 
right 
um so other Studies have documented 
increasing narcissism among college 
students since the late 80s 
so a recent May meta-analysis which kind 
of takes into account all studies that 
have been done 
um 
found that when 
you know when when we were in college 
um 70 
of people had normal to high you know 
levels of empathy and 30 percent had you 
know lower to depressed levels of 
empathy 
um just take a guess what it is now 
for lowered maybe half of people have 
reduced empathy or lowered empathy it's 
flipped 
oh so 70 it's 70 30 the other way now 30 
percent of people have normal levels of 
empathy and 70 don't they're more 
indifferent yes so so there is there's 
something here right that is going to 
play out in relationship we also see are 
seeing it play out in broader culture 
we're seeing that 
um but then there's also something to 
this early life trauma component as well 
right 
so 
um someone who's coming into 
relationship and whether with a 
significant amount of early life trauma 
um if she gets with somebody who has a 
really depleted empathy or high levels 
of narcissism that's going to be 
especially damaging she's going to be 
especially vulnerable and really not as 
prone as other people to get herself out 
of that situation 
um at the same time she's she is going 
to be 
um pretty harmed by a jerk too right so 
at some point it doesn't totally matter 
what she's bringing to the table 
um is something that is an entity unto 
itself that needs to be addressed 
for her happy relating why do I say that 
because so much of what's out there is 
erase the narcissist and you're going to 
be fine 
that's right that's not really true 
um but what's most likely to happen is 
that you're likely to stay in this kind 
of subconscious 
um trauma cycle 
um and not really ever get to your full 
embodied alive self 
and I think the gift in this Dynamic and 
in this conversation is that often these 
narcissistic relationships are so bad 
that they push us into kind of our Dark 
Night of the Soul 
and that forces us to do the work 
that we might not have other otherwise 
ever done 
and I see that with so many of my 
clients 
so 
yeah I you know Michelle I see this with 
our clients as well when they have this 
kind of repetitive history right and 
we'll tell them and we take them through 
our exercises like who is your elevator 
person who's your high GHQ guy here are 
your red flags okay and now you're ready 
to launch and what we often find is when 
women and frankly men right when when we 
come in to the dating space but we have 
these prior traumas that when we're 
presented with a good solid human being 
that maybe has to cure attachment right 
what do we hear from these clients he's 
boring he's boring boring like I'm just 
bored I need someone a little more 
exciting a little more edgy and and I 
tell them you're looking for somebody to 
activate your nervous system to put you 
on the edge to make you feel like you're 
walking on shells because we've come to 
mistake 
excitement and dysfunction 
exactly 
exactly and that's why I always say 
it's actually a pretty dangerous time to 
start dating again if you really want a 
healthy partner until you are really 
sure that you have done this work 
because even if you have you know left 
your most recent narcissistic partner if 
you go into the dating pool and you're 
you've got you know Bella around you 
with the you know the bumper pads and 
you're only getting the good guys in 
there 
um 
that it could cause a relapse because 
this fear that there's not going to be 
that jolt of you know electricity 
could often Drive 
um 
drives women in this Dynamic back 
and I bet you see that too I see that 
all the time in my practice we do we do 
and we highlight it pretty quickly like 
hey I think this is pattern this person 
if they're not narcissistic maybe 
they're avoidant you know we call P you 
know people that are more avoidant like 
they're broken koala bears right they 
they want to attach but their legs are 
broken and they can't so while they can 
be good human beings and good friends 
and good sons and daughters and parents 
in romantic relationships a different 
side emerges and we take that early 
childhood trauma and it can be some and 
it transfers into our romantic 
relationships so there are signs signs 
are often missed in the beginning and 
that's what we've become really good at 
helping people identify because there 
are Clues and the clues are there if 
you're looking for that and the clues 
are also there if you might be avoidant 
and you might be wanting somebody who's 
more dysfunctional and exciting and oh 
this is boring and so we will these are 
things that we work with people on on a 
daily basis because sometimes it's kind 
of to your point we go back to what's 
familiar we may reenact things sometimes 
what we know intellectually to be right 
isn't what feels good or feels 
comfortable so we regress to that it's 
like we all know how you know 
intellectually if I said how can I lose 
10 pounds I would say okay eat less move 
more right but how many but how hard is 
that to do everything is in the 
execution and that's where the rubber 
hits the road 
yeah 
yeah so it's just like you said fear can 
sometimes be mistaken for excitement and 
intimate relationships and unfortunately 
this High state of anxiety can become 
the glue that binds people together in 
unhealthy bonds 
and the absence of it can feel boring or 
empty I call this phase living Gray 
he's gone I'm supposed to be happy but 
now I'm empty because I my nervous 
system isn't constantly being activated 
as it has probably been since I was 
a tiny girl right yeah therefore it 
feels like we're never gonna experience 
aliveness again we're alive but we don't 
feel alive that's true that's what 
trauma really feels like 
and so dating again too soon it creates 
a huge relapse risk where trauma bonds 
are present 
and not only dating too soon you might 
wait 10 years but if you haven't done 
the work to heal that right is what 
you're saying with the EMDR and did you 
call it ifs and somatic therapy and 
attachment work right and do that and 
then get yourself a friendly 
neighborhood dating coach that's going 
to wrap you in bubble wrap and pink 
sparkles and make sure that you stay the 
F away from narcissistic abuse so 
there's a whole thing and if you're 
listening to this and it feels like you 
what I want you to know is this is not 
your fault it's not your fault right oh 
it ended and this is this is not even 
there's a 
this is not even a rare problem yeah I 
mean this is 
very few of us get out of our childhoods 
without some sort of 
um just some sort of trauma 
um and 
and that's not to say that everyone has 
this problem but it is it is not a rare 
problem either that's why we're seeing 
so much of it and like I said earlier 
there is some sort of cultural shift 
here 
um and I I could speculate on you know 
reasons why social media is playing 
likely playing a role totally 
I've got a 14 year old and an 18 year 
old and I can tell you you know kovid 
certainly did a number on kids and the 
time that they spend on social media 
platforms looking at bikini photos of 
other people and what like I don't look 
good enough I'm not thin enough I'm not 
pretty enough look at how rip that guy 
is I need to work out more I need to 
take creatine like I live with this 
right I've got and and I see and I can 
see where this could lead to a flip to a 
reduction in empathy to a spotlight on 
yourself to a spotlight on your flaws 
your perceived flaws which leads to 
depression it's like God can we throw 
our phones away let's go back to the 
clam phone so 
um you know some days I think to myself 
in 10 or 20 years we're going to look at 
cell phones or we're going to look at 
social media the way we look at smoking 
yeah I hope so 
and doing the work you do and doing the 
work that I do I think we're very 
aligned in in all of this so you know 
you mentioned that there's this 
pervasiveness and we just speculated the 
why about narcissism and narcissistic 
abuse and is it as pervasive sounds like 
hell to the yeah it's as pervasive as it 
seems is is that a fair statement I I 
think that it is I also think that not 
everything that's happening here 
um is about that narcissists are 
horrible people I think that this is a 
dance of trauma 
and that 
um 
and that in a lot of ways I mean the 
same trauma that is creating 
um a repetition compulsion 
um on the part of 
um the part the partners that we're 
talking about also plays a role in kind 
of the narcissistic defense right or the 
avoidant defense 
um there's there's different types of 
um trauma response fight flight freeze 
and fun 
each of those types um creates different 
patterns of behavior 
um fight 
um is you know fight to stay safe flight 
is run away to stay safe or keep you 
know they they tend to keep busy all the 
time 
freeze are the dissociators check out 
disconnect and The Fawns are the ones 
take care of everything make sure 
everyone is okay so we but at the core 
of all of that you don't get a trauma 
response without 
something you know happening in the 
beginning and 
and so what's creating all of this it's 
it's likely originating from a lot of 
the same sourcing 
and I know for a lot of my clients they 
really struggle with 
um what is really pushed I think on 
social media and that is this idea that 
narcissists are evil and 
I mean certainly a lack of empathy is 
not something that you want to run up 
against it's not something no that I'm 
never going to condone or defend 
but 
um 
people hurt people hurt people that's 
right um and you can understand that 
um 
24 hours a day but unless you decide to 
do your own healing work 
you're likely not gonna ever 
um really fully Escape that pattern 
because you're part of that you had 
Rachel Graham on your Show recently and 
I was really loving what she was talking 
about with self-responsibility this is 
not victim blaming I always tell my 
clients this is not your fault what 
happened to you when you were a kid or 
when you were in that relationship 
not your fault 
um you didn't ask for it you didn't 
deserve any of it none of it and it is 
totally your responsibility to clean it 
up 
because no one else is going to do that 
for you no you can stay in this identity 
of 
a victim of what has happened to you 
yeah or you can go and do the healing 
work and step outside of it oh and let 
me tell you I wallowed in that identity 
myself personally for a good long while 
um so I I it is not 
um it is not something that I am 
trying to be judgmental about it's an 
easy thing to do 
but you really can get stuck in that 
identity and that identity does serve 
you for a while it helps you make sense 
of what's happened and what you're 
understanding 
but you cannot stay there forever and 
have what my goal for myself and my 
clients is and that's post-traumatic 
growth that's right that is what you get 
when you're willing to take a look at 
all of the dark stuff 
sit in it process it feel the pain 
inst instead of shopping it away or 
smoking it away or drinking it away or 
relationshiping it away 
sitting in it feeling it and then 
turning um 
self-parenting 
um 
taking care of yourself doing things in 
a new way when you do that you come out 
on the other side a completely different 
person really the you I think you are 
always supposed to be that's right 
that's the gift of it 
if you choose to take it 
one hundred percent and you know I one 
of the things I really believe in life 
is if you can find the meaning in the 
mess around you right you you can shift 
and like we were talking about in that 
previous episode you go from victim and 
find wallow like you're saying and being 
a victim but then you become the Creator 
you become the Creator and you go into 
this empowered Dynamic like okay that 
sucked and that was horrible but now how 
do I how do I get out of that I've sat 
with it then you go and work with Dr 
Roberts and you get all of the therapy 
and you get the EMDR and you do the 
coaching and you heal yourself and then 
you get assistance around dating so that 
somebody's whispering in your ear and 
looking in your inbox and listening to 
what the dates are are are are are 
looking like and feeling like to tell 
you no oh that's not good for you but 
this one is right and that's ultimately 
all of the resources that now exist out 
there didn't exist 30 years ago right we 
didn't even know these things and so now 
if this feels like oh my God oh my God 
this is touching a nerve the good news 
is is that there's a lot of help out 
there and there are people that can help 
you and there are people that can 
understand you and get you to a better 
place so be inspired to take that first 
step take that action to getting 
yourself the the the guard rails around 
you right if you were going to jump out 
of an airplane if you were like I'm 
going to go skydiving right that's the 
you know let's say that's dating for a 
lot of you that have had trauma in the 
past nobody's gonna let you get up in a 
plane and go jump out of the plane alone 
you know what they're going to do is 
they're going to put you through a four 
hour you know learning thing in videos 
and then they're gonna strap skydiving 
instructor to you before you jump out of 
that plane nobody gonna let you jump out 
by yourself even if you're like I got 
this no you don't you don't have this 
you want someone strapped to you that 
has another shoot because what if your 
shoot doesn't open so that's the same 
thing in this process and and so many of 
us have traumas I know we follow Dr Amir 
Levine's work as well who wrote the book 
attached and he says you know if you if 
you add it up 25 of people are reported 
to be emotionally avoidant 20 are 
anxious in attachment style and five 
percent are anxious avoidant guys that's 
one in two okay one and two okay and now 
Michelle's saying that 70 percent has 
flipped to the other side if people with 
reduced empathy you gotta have some you 
gotta have some new skills when you get 
out there and the good news is is we're 
really here to help you to do that and 
if this sounds like you feels like you 
know you're just like at minimum at 
least half of the people on planet Earth 
if not more at this point you know and 
Michelle what are the five best pieces 
of advice that you can give to survivors 
I just love that you've got and I'm 
you've given so many great pieces of 
advice but do you have five more that 
you could just you know 
you know blow our minds with or however 
many you have well we anyone who's been 
through a trauma Bond 
um 
or an addiction you know we put we play 
these games with ourselves we Gaslight 
ourselves 
um to stay safe we convince ourselves 
that it's not that bad right the my 
first piece of advice is make a 
commitment to live in reality if you 
find yourself wanting to fantasize about 
what could be or what you hope will be 
um remind yourself that you've made a 
commitment to living the truth even if 
you don't choose to leave the 
relationship immediately in the meantime 
you can at least remind yourself that 
you will have to stop fantasizing about 
what isn't there when we're little kids 
and our parents are not there for us we 
have no choice but to fantasize it there 
that is how we survive our childhoods we 
do that when we're adults too and we 
create these fantasy bonds and we can 
live in those bonds with partners that 
are not there for us for a long time so 
make a commitment to live in reality 
understand the hook identify what 
exactly you're losing 
um it might be a fantasy a dream an 
illusion maybe your partner convinced 
you into believing they were going to 
fulfill some deep unmet need in you once 
you can identify with that need or hook 
is you can get down to the business of 
grieving it grieving means holding your 
hands open and letting it go 
you say goodbye to the notion that the 
need you have may never be met at a 
minimum it will not be met by this 
relationship 
and when you say understand the hook it 
means understand what this person was 
giving you what need they were 
fulfilling what hook what hooked you in 
or what hooked you and then understand 
that was an illusion it's not reality 
they cannot provide that need for you 
and grieve it 
okay often often 
um the this illusion of 
connection and bonding 
um 
even though we know it's not there if we 
have kind of just the trappings of the 
relationship 
even though he's not coming home or 
doing all of these things narcissists or 
not right if it's not fulfilling if it 
if it has this kind of 
a facade to it 
um it just fills this fantasy need 
and for people with trauma sometimes 
that is we can live there for a very 
long time okay and then because our 
nervous systems are you know so 
disassociated 
um as well we're never really being 
embodied or in the moment 
so um that is that's a really important 
thing another one is write a bottom line 
um list of bottom line behaviors for 
yourself some possibilities I will not 
sleep with someone who calls me names 
I will not argue with someone who has 
been drinking I will take care of my own 
finances I will not have conversations 
with anyone when I feel desperate or 
defensive or obsessive whatever your 
areas of concern just determine on what 
you need to do to change and make those 
your bottom line behaviors I bet you 
could help someone come up with a list 
of those too Bella oh I love them build 
your own Sweet Life this was the best 
part of my own recovery and it involved 
rescuing a couple 
retired Greyhounds something I never 
thought I would do there's a whole story 
about that but just little by little 
start dreaming about your future for 
yourself and your children if you have 
them in other words make dreams that 
don't involve this person maybe you want 
to go to school that's what I did start 
a hobby go to church join a Club just 
start making some life-affirming choices 
for yourself that take you away from 
these toxic interactions that have been 
destroying your peace of mind and then 
finally and this is so important not 
being with this person does not mean 
isolate yourself it doesn't mean stop 
relating 
um the only way to be really free from 
unhealthy connections is to start 
investing in healthy ones and they do 
not have to be romantic 
um develop other close connected and 
bonded relationships that are not 
centered on drama and make these your 
go-to people your family of choice 
it's really hard to heal without support 
So notice the people in your life who 
show you loving concern and if you I 
have some clients who have had this 
accumulation of trauma over their life 
and they really struggle to to find a 
group like that 
um get a good therapist to start 
therapists helpers that you can that you 
turn to 
um and you you hire to help you they 
count my therapist she counts totally 
she was around zero I love that oh my
