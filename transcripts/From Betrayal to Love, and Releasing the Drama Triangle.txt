healing 
after 
betrayal rachel is here with us because 
which one of us hasn't been betrayed and 
we've all had to figure out our way or 
maybe for you 
you're still down there on the ground 
figuring out how can i heal and i found 
that so long as i stayed in that victim 
mentality or my friends even supported 
me staying in that victim mentality by 
saying yeah you know he's at this or 
that or whatever our family members and 
so i did a lot of personal healing to 
get through this particular situation 
and get to the other side to where i 
actually am healthier for having gone 
through this can you find the meaning in 
the mess 
at that moment you are literally on your 
knees in the water and you feel this 
hand pulling you up by the collar saying 
i'm going to show you the way out
