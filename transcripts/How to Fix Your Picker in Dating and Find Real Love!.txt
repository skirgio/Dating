like tell us what you you know what you

Maryland to Big Maryland 
foreign 
let's see what do I do so when I first 
started dating my husband I told him I 
work at a candy company and he said 
which one and I said well I can't tell 
you that you might be a stalker I don't 
know he goes well if you work at Milky 
Way you might be 
my girlfriend 
[Laughter] 
zip I said nothing for like months 
because you know I mean we've all dated 
those weird stalker people I did not 
need someone I had not even been at my 
job for very long maybe a few years and 
I didn't want some random guy showing up 
so it was months before I told him I did 
work in Milky Way 
working at a candy company and we're 
going to come back to 
growth in your career that happened 
along with all of your growth so tell us 
like you grew up in the South right 
I did so originally I'm from Memphis 
Tennessee 
um I've got family in Nashville Memphis 
Mississippi Louisiana 
and my dad was in the Navy so I grew up 
a Navy brat so we while we spent a few 
years down South by the time I was in 
second grade we had moved overseas and I 
didn't come back until just before high 
school 
oh wow okay and then and then what 
happened tell us about your tell us 
about your dating life Maryland dollar 
I mean look even when I first came to 
you I said dating is not the problem I 
get plenty of dates 
it's they're not 
good husband quality uh we have her 
brainwashed GHQ do you hear that so 
and you so 
right okay so you dated you were married 
what was your first marriage how old 
were you and how did that happen please 
as she groans in the background I don't 
like to talk about that one well let's 
see I was 17. okay I I was you know we 
moved from the Azores back to the states 
to Texas which is in its own right a 
foreign country 
for real and it was very Bible Belt and 
you know you don't sleep around you 
don't date around do you meet someone at 
church and you get married and so that's 
kind of what I did I met somebody at 
church 
I got married 
turns out 
he was a real 
you can say it 
yeah he was just a not a good husband 
quality material 
and we moved to Great Falls Montana 
from Houston Texas 
and it was just it was a really dark 
time in my life I was away from all my 
family all my friends I had had a lot of 
loss in my life at that time my best 
friend from within my senior year of 
high school my best friend from Junior 
High 
was killed in a car accident my my 
another guy that I was dating in high 
school was killed in a car accident with 
my best friend oh my um 
freshman year of college I just started 
college and I was in a sorority 
and my sorority sister and I did 
everything together she committed 
suicide and I was just like 
I'm out of here this other guy that I 
had been seeing on and off right he 
proposed and he had this little promise 
oh if we were married Uncle Sam will pay 
for your way and we'll go back to the 
Azores I'm like he painted this whole 
picture and I bought into it 
but you know the reality was he got 
shipped out to Great Falls Montana they 
were six feet of snow they didn't use 
salt he took my car I couldn't drive 
and he was super abusive 
and I thought I was going crazy turns 
out he was just gaslighting me oh and it 
took me about three months to kind of 
realize this was a pattern this isn't 
one off you know he would an abusive 
situation with a guy like that looks 
like this he comes home everything's 
great he makes up some story 
knocks me around and then pretends later 
like nothing ever happened or says I 
don't know what came over me that'll 
never happen again this just continued 
to happen over and over and I thought 
I gotta get out of here but he was so 
controlling and oppressive there was 
really no way for me to get out 
so finally uh I think it was New Year's 
Eve I had gotten fired from my job 
because I was late all the time I was in 
and out of the hospital with bruises 
contusions head injuries broken ribs I 
mean 
horrible 
but I was so young I didn't know I just 
I didn't know what to do I didn't have 
any resources 
and I knew when I told him that I got 
fired that he was going to 
do something terrible I just could feel 
it and sure enough he did 
and I remember having this kind of out 
of body experience and um 
I thought you know this is not the way I 
go I have so much I want to give to the 
world I'm 18 at this point sorry this 
got really dark all of a sudden you're 
18. it was 18. 
um and I thought I I uh I gotta do 
something and so 
I we have this big fight and 
I was a mess he broke my nose and my jaw 
and it was terrible 
somehow I convinced him to go get us 
some alcohol for 
New Year's Eve 
and I called my dad and I said I'm 
leaving and he said don't leave until I 
get there and I said I don't know that 
I'll make it till the morning 
and he said I'll be there in the morning 
and he was and he did come and get me 
and my cat and we drove the long way 
home oh my God it was terrible from 
Great Falls Montana in January down to 
Houston Texas oh my God and he was 
just you know no judgment 
telling me 
you know what my future was is going to 
be bright and I this was going to pass 
and it was just it was a terrible time 
but it it really showed me how much my 
dad cared for me 
and uh and after that I mean probably 
solid 10 years I just I was anti-dating 
anti-man I said never get married again 
forget about it 
and then I met another guy at work and I 
thought well I'm meeting him at work 
we're both smart you know it's fine 
um and so I I married him and we had two 
wonderful kids which I loved I stayed 
home for 10 years with them 
and all through this so I had a lot of 
therapy after that first marriage I did 
a lot of volunteering at women's 
shelters to just 
understand it wasn't anything I did 
or somehow my fault it was a 
circumstantial piece of my life and many 
women struggled to get out of that 
pattern and grateful that I was able to 
have the support around me to get out of 
that 
so falling into another relationship I 
thought would never happen again 
and it didn't in that same way but there 
are a lot of different ways that men or 
anyone in a relationship if they're 
controlling can hold you back yeah and 
and so in that second marriage now I 
have kids now I'm a stay-at-home mom so 
it's another form of control if you will 
we didn't share bank accounts sure he he 
went to work I stayed home I'm like 
where am I gonna get the money 
I still had to pay for groceries and all 
the things the kids wanted to do so 
summer camp and football and baseball 
and all the things 
and so it's funny full circle 
many times there was a woman who worked 
at the candy company I work for now and 
she was in charge of taste testing which 
one of my girlfriends had told me about 
and I would call her up and I would say 
Lee 
I need to go to the Aldi this week 
can I come in and chew some gum and she 
would say every time come in in a 30 
minutes I would choose some gum and I 
would get a check and I would go buy 
groceries 
and when I started working there years 
later she said 
you have transformed so much it has been 
so wonderful to watch I'm so happy for 
you 
so you never know where you're gonna be 
years later who I never would have a 
million years thought I'd be working 
there as I am now 
so 
um 
when I was married and staying at home 
with these kids 
and my husband had this great job and he 
came home and said 
yeah I I don't think I want to be 
married anymore 
I'm like wait what I was not expecting 
that right out of nowhere out of nowhere 
and turned out he had been having an 
emotional affair with someone at his 
work which is very common 
but he did not really want to work on it 
and I I remember thinking to myself how 
how am I going to do this and my friends 
helped me with some vision board 
exercises and and we just we just got 
together and talked about it like what 
are the situations what are the 
scenarios my one girlfriend who's a CFO 
said let's draw out three Financial 
scenarios and see what what you could do 
right you could stay at home continue to 
do your stampin Up business maybe take 
on a part-time business but you won't be 
able to keep the house 
you could go to work full-time but then 
you have to pay for child care you could 
go to work full-time and keep your 
stampin Up business but you won't have 
any personal life and so I had these 
situations but he said oh you'll never 
leave me you don't even have a job 
well 
challenge accepted challenge accepted 
but wait he wanted the divorce but he he 
changed his hand he changed his mind 
then okay so he has this emotional 
affair you lay out the scenarios but 
he's like I don't want to work on it but 
wait I don't want a divorce so basically 
just accept me having this affair and 
Let's Stay Together isn't that great 
heads I win Tales you lose 
not in a million years no not doing it 
bye boy but controlling right and this 
is their mindset the narcissist 
100 percent 
and I didn't know I was just like okay 
my girlfriends are telling me that I 
should just leave so what can I do 
and so that's that's what I did and I 
said I gotta get a job now I'm gonna get 
a job and 
my girlfriends we were just talking 
about this the other day said 
um well who do you know that works and I 
said I don't need anyone who works all 
my girlfriends are stay-at-home moms we 
all have you know these little 
businesses that we have but it's not 
enough to pay a mortgage 
and they said well 
um 
who did you used to know when you used 
to work 
and I thought oh my god I've been out of 
work for 10 years I 
well I used to know this girl Carol and 
we still get back together you know for 
lunch every Christmas all right we'll 
call Carol and Carol and I started at 
Quaker Oats back in the day 
and she was so fun and I was there when 
Pepsi bought us I worked for Pepsi for a 
while 
and uh and I said well Carol let's get 
together for lunch so we did 
and I said 
um do you remember my old boss Julian 
she goes yeah I think she's working at 
this candy company 
I said oh well I should call her what or 
what's her email and so I called her I 
emailed her and she called me back she 
goes oh my God I was just thinking about 
you how are you and I said well Julia 
I'm going through a divorce 
and you know it's messy 
she said come in and let's have lunch 
so we came in I came in we had lunch and 
she said I got some projects would you 
consider working on them I said I can 
only work ten to two because my kids are 
in school I mean I was I had such a 
little mindset back then 
and I said um could you could you work 
that out she goes yeah absolutely 
and so three weeks into that somehow 
like there's a 21 day rule with me I 
don't know what it is except for the 30 
30 90 day rule that that's still a thing 
that's my rule I know and I I agree and 
adhere to that 
important 
and I am 
at the end of three weeks she came up to 
me and said if we could 
find enough work for you to work 
full-time would you consider that on a 
temp basis through Christmas and I said 
sure I'll figure it out and I did I got 
my kids in after school care I got them 
to be able to ride the bus to school I 
got a girlfriend of mine to help me out 
and I transitioned full-time 
and while they were in 
at their grandmother's house for 
Thanksgiving 
I moved out of my house 
oh and I got an apartment okay and I had 
no furniture I took their clothes and 
the stuff from the bathroom and that was 
it and all my girlfriends I mean it was 
like these graduation parties that you 
saw during covet where people were just 
driving around the block my girlfriends 
are just coming and dropping stuff off 
my one girlfriend gave me a table that 
had been in her garage 
a couple of beds for the kids I mean my 
whole apartment was furnished by my 
friends 
and the kids came home on Thanksgiving 
and I picked them up and we walked in 
the back door and then we walked out the 
front door and got in my car and drove 
to the apartment 
oh my God so scary so I had been at work 
three weeks 
I had an apartment 
the kids were doing fine I was still 
doing my Stampin business still working 
full-time 
and I started traveling a lot for work 
and I thought I can't do this stamping 
business and try to date and 
try to be at all the kids football games 
and be the football mom and all that 
something's got to give 
so I gave up my 
stamping business that I had done for 12 
years a lot of friends and those are 
like stamps on cards right like yeah 
like uh yeah I don't have one in front 
of me but we still will send cards to 
each other right that we've we've done 
you sent me one but we'll get to that 
yeah yeah yeah uh and we still well it's 
just a creative outlet for us and I said 
uh I got to make some room in my life 
for dating 
and uh when I did that I was dating this 
really interesting guy that I had met on 
Tinder 
and it was a great year if it was I'll 
call it the Gap year 
of spending a lot of time either in the 
bedroom or at the Home Depot he was very 
handy 
wait 
or oh Home Depot that was that was your 
foreign back into the dating world again 
this is pretty smart dating Academy 
people don't get yourself all excited 
right now 
you know he he he had a lot of expertise 
in many areas and I was very happy for 
that year but every time that I would 
bring up to him hey the exclusive 
conversation or when can I meet your mom 
who just lives like a couple of suburbs 
over he was always like avoiding that 
and he hung out at my house mostly and 
just the whole thing seemed kind of 
shady 
uh but he was a great guy he was a 
Polish guy really big strong 
um but he he just he was not a family 
guy wasn't into my kids he only came 
over when they weren't there I mean it 
was just you could tell this was not 
going anywhere 
so I said oh okay well 
you know let's uh I'm gonna go I've got 
to this trip I'm going to Istanbul and 
you know really miss you and you know 
all the things so I get to Istanbul and 
uh 
I had become friends with a couple of 
people that I had been working on the 
meeting with for quite a long time and 
so we hung out and 
just had a great time and I tried to 
call the Polish guy like every day he 
didn't didn't pick up the phone I 
thought well it's the time difference 
like all the things and you're calling 
him from Europe oh yeah I'm calling him 
from from Turkey you're paying Rome 
charges I know it's terrible it was so 
it was Dumb and uh finally 
it was a long trip back on the airplane 
and I thought you know why am I doing 
this I just had this great international 
meeting that I put together for a 
hundred people coming in from all over 
the world I organized the whole thing it 
was amazing 
and yet this guy is treating me like 
I don't even know not the way I should 
be treated there's just something wrong 
and I got off that airplane and I called 
him from the taxi and I said you know I 
just don't think this is working out 
and then the next call was I called you 
and I said okay I think I'm ready what 
do we need to do 
now if now correct me if my memory is 
wrong you at that moment you did call 
but you and I had met as you reminded me 
at an event 
at the Chicago Tribune at the trip yeah 
or Heidi Stevens but one of the 
journalists from the tribuneer Amy 
Dickinson I think it was asking baby 
right that's right it was the advice the 
national advice columnist ask Amy we 
were doing an event together and I think 
Jen or Heidi somebody was moderating it 
but you were in the audience at the 
Tribune Tower and we talked for a minute 
and then I think we kept in touch via 
Facebook yep and you had sent me one of 
those cute little stamp cards I remember 
I still have it in my closet because I I 
never throw away notes that people give 
me so I'm I'm funny like that words of 
affirmation are are great so then 
Marilyn sends me a message and says I 
think I'm ready and I think the message 
probably came on Facebook 
I'm ready to do this I was like are you 
sure because I thought you were ready a 
few times you're like no no no now I'm 
really ready and then let me tell you 
guys when Marilyn says she's ready 
she's ready so so now you engage with us 
and you go through our process and you 
fill out our documents and we meet you 
at the Four Seasons okay and 
and so I'm giving you my impressionistic 
memory so now you show up there and 
you're sparkling as you can all hear her 
personality and she showed up and she 
had this kind of chin length kind of 
curly hair and these glasses on and this 
outfit that was just kind of you know 
whatever she's like I just you know we 
were talking about style and the 
importance of how you look on the 
outside and how that's going to make you 
feel on the inside and she said do you 
think I should have my hair curly or 
straight and I just remember going well 
where do you feel prettier 
she's like oh when my hair is straight 
so now we have this conversation we have 
this conversation with lots of people 
right about you know what are the things 
you can do to make yourself really feel 
good and dating 
so we have this meeting three hours we 
on Border we're like she's great she's 
gonna do well so a week later 
I was keynoting a match.com singles 
event for women and presenting like how 
to find the perfect guy and I go through 
this whole and Andy my husband came to 
help me set up because I am do you think 
I can set up a projector come on like no 
that's out of balagandi's skill set 
right like I can speak I can make the 
audience laugh but don't make me put the 
projector so so at so I finish up my 
talk and This Woman's like oh my gosh 
that was great you know is that guy your 
I.T guy and they said well that I.T guy 
is my husband who's in finance and 
private Equity but he's a great guy and 
so she's and she's talking to me as if 
we know each other and I was like oh 
have we met 
no 
and guess who it was dear listener it 
was Maryland dollar Maryland had changed 
her appearance literally was it even a 
week like I'm not exaggerating like a 
few days it was a few days so Marilyn 
decided that she was going to drink up 
the information that we talked about and 
execute in like this rapid fire Way new 
look she had her hair that was Curly and 
you know puffy and I can say that 
because I'm a curly puffy haired girl 
too naturally and that's how we talked 
about the Keratin Maryland went out got 
her hair straightened it was so 
dramatically different that I didn't 
even recognize my own client her outfit 
she looked Chic her hair I was like 
Marilyn she's like remember we met last 
week like I'm your client I was I was 
rendered speechless at that point and 
I'm sure you remember this moment as 
well so what a compliment and what a 
testament to you where you just were 
like okay girl you want me to do what 
and then I'm gonna do this too 
unrecognizable and how did you feel 
uh and so it was funny because you had 
said well something like can a guy run 
his fingers through your hair and I'm 
like no like never I can't even get a 
brush no okay then you gotta you've got 
to do something with that and I just 
felt 
you know I don't want someone to judge 
me by how I look I want someone to judge 
me well first I don't want anybody to 
judge me I just want to show up like I 
am and I want everyone to have a good 
time and 
be happy 
but what I recognized was 
not everyone has that same filter 
especially guys 
right 
and while I said before I had no problem 
getting dates that was never the problem 
it was 
getting dates with guys who saw 
immediately that I had value 
yeah and so overnight it made me feel 
like people took me more seriously 
they recognize that I was smart 
and I felt like they saw immediately 
that I had value 
and that was a huge shift for me I I 
always knew that I had had that but the 
first two failed relationships that I 
had 
that I that was evidence I couldn't deny 
um and I never wanted to repeat that 
again no no and I and I remember doing 
this video exercise with you and we 
talked about softening up body language 
and how you present with good energy and 
it's good to make people feel accepted 
and warm and you I just remember how you 
lit up the camera when we had you do it 
with a smile on your face and it's like 
the whole world started to change for 
you and started to change like 
like suddenly right dating changed work 
changed tell us about everything like 
you did your photo shoot with this new 
look literally if I say to you guys 
Marilyn broke the internet I mean what 
kind of response did you get from those 
photos that we took oh my God that was 
crazy and I tell my girlfriends this 
overnight my 
matches went from 
a lot of city workers and I've no 
problem with city workers I believe in 
hard work ethic and people who work 
um with that feeling of what they're 
doing is important and 
I work in Corporate America 
I've always wanted someone else that 
understood what that was like I wanted 
someone who worked in Corporate America 
this is not a hard thing to ask for 
overnight I went from a a guy that I had 
gone out with in the last week was a 
pipefitter 
another guy I went out with a week 
before worked at a steel mill another 
guy was a machinist and another guy was 
an auto mechanic I could not make this 
up 
once AJ did that photo shoot and you and 
Lindsay helped me rewrite my copy just a 
little bit 
it went from that to 
I had a date with 
an attorney who had his own practice 
a doctor who worked at Northwestern 
I 
um Banker 
uh 
uh and a guy who worked downtown I mean 
it was immediate and it wasn't just like 
these three it was three pages of guys 
pages I just it was super overwhelming 
and you had said I had been on match for 
a while 
and then I had dated this guy who went 
full court press on me and that didn't 
work out so when I came back and hit the 
reset button 
you suggested that I try eHarmony 
and that's even more intense because you 
got to fill out all this these questions 
like it's 128 questions or something 
and it was just miraculous at the kind 
of quality of people that started 
showing up and they would write these 
really lovely emails to me and it was 
amazing overnight although I will say 
uh one guy asked me if I was a 
professional 
proportional what 
you said your pictures are just a little 
too good to be true what are you really 
doing and I'm like no those are those 
are really the pictures they're not 
touched up or anything that's the way 
they look because uh take a picture with 
your camera which I did I just did the 
cell then he goes oh all right well uh 
what are you doing this Friday 
right this is not the man she ended up 
marrying by the way 
it was very fun and so we have lots of 
dates all different kinds like Marilyn 
said there's no slight on city workers 
and she dated plenty of those but her 
manifestation now that she had become 
more successful in the corporate world 
was I want to date more white collar 
guys that can understand the world that 
I live in and so now we started to date 
lots of these guys our big mission was 
to make sure that mayor fixed her picker 
and did not gravitate back to somebody 
who was 
narcissistic 
avoidant red flaggy and you know that 
they're even though you know 
some the information about what a 
narcissist is you know you might be in 
therapy right you're doing your work but 
the gravitational pull towards what is 
familiar which could be dysfunctional 
red flaggy edgy it's a high pull right 
oh yeah 
yeah because it's what you know and 
narcissists tend to gravitate towards 
helpers nurturers women who are 
um helpful 
right because they they feel like oh 
well this is this is my world this is 
what I deserve all the time without 
reciprocity 
oh it will I call narcissists or takers 
and the taker needs a giver right and 
givers like to give Until you realize 
you're putting sunlight into a black 
hole and nothing's gonna come out of it 
we can't just give and give and give and 
give and give even though we're a giver 
because we're human and we need to get 
something back right and that's where 
narcissists don't do so well because 
they're like well wait you can never 
give enough to a narcissist never it's a 
pot with a huge hole right exactly 
exactly so so if we go back now in time 
so we dated all kinds we had some green 
flag guys we had some red flag guys oh 
did we have some red flag guys right so 
we could toss those if you could see our 
faces right now we're laughing because 
there's some real Doozers that came into 
your funnel right and nobody would have 
known it but we gave them all time and 
time weeds out all the Kooks you guys 
crazy cannot hide for that long so if 
you give someone enough time they're 
gonna show they're crazy right and we 
got rid of a lot of crazy but then there 
was that one special email that came 
through now tell us about tell us about 
uh tell us about this guy that uh that 
asked you out on a date named Jim 
so Jim 
was 
um 
you know he looked like a pretty laid 
back so 
I was dating these crazy guys it's true 
and then you had said to me 
hey what if we expanded the age bracket 
because I I wanted to date men in the 
city who were my age or younger 
that was my that was my my bubble 
and you said well what if we set the 
range like 50 to 100 miles away 
I'm like I I don't want some Suburban 
guy and you're like well let's just try 
it like all right okay uh I'm coachable 
I'm gonna do okay I'm doing what she 
says it's worked so far so I spread that 
and then you said and let's go 
equidistant 
10 years younger 
to 10 years older I'm like 10 years 
older I'm like God I gotta be retiring 
and you're like let's just see what 
happens 
so I opened the aperture on that 
and within I'd say a week so this is 
roughly May ish 
and I had reset I had reset in I think 
February 
and uh this guy sent me this email 
within a couple of days after this and 
it was like paragraphs like nobody 
speaks in paragraphs you might get a 
sentence or two and usually very 
inappropriate with crappy spelling 
and then this guy 
said I loved your profile you seem like 
a lot of fun uh tell me a little bit 
more about you know your kids or 
whatever I had talked about I I remember 
there was a part of my I was into 
running I did a 5k every month 
and I I remember putting in my profile I 
love to run during the week and then 
wreck it on the weekend with pizza which 
I still do I love Lou Malnati's big fan 
and so I said uh yeah I'm running in a 
5k this weekend 
and then the next day he sent me another 
email oh tell me about this 5K what made 
you decide to do this and I don't 
remember which one it was now and I 
think it was the Ravenswood and I said 
well I used to live there when I first 
moved to Chicago you know and we're just 
having this wonderful conversation 
and about a week into it he said well 
you know these conversations have been 
great and I found myself looking forward 
to coming home from work putting the 
kids to bed getting in the tub and then 
reading his email like that was my daily 
I hope this guy emailed me back 
because you're just so great 
and he said I would love to meet you in 
person and get off this website well I 
mean how many guys say that oh my free 
time is expiring so I thought I would 
see another one of those guys and I'm 
like whoa let's talk on the phone so we 
talked on the phone and he asked me out 
and uh he asked me out for Friday night 
and I said Friday night really and I 
remember reading in the book 
uh he's just not Not That Into You if he 
doesn't ask you out on a week and night 
he's not that serious and I thought oh 
Friday night this is Friday night he's 
giving me his Friday night can't believe 
it so we uh we were gonna meet at a 
little restaurant close to where I live 
so in case I had to run home I could 
so we are going to meet there and I I 
was so nervous of course I was running 
late but I did make it in 
and he had this beautiful dozen red 
roses he was sitting at the bar we had a 
glass of wine he goes I and we're 
there's only one table in the restaurant 
that's empty and it's the table he had 
reserved for dinner but I didn't want to 
commit to dinner so we were just sitting 
at the bar drinking a glass of wine so 
after this glass of wine he gives me the 
Roses he says well this is our table if 
you would like to stay for dinner and 
I'm like 
yeah okay I'll I'll stay for dinner 
and why not I thought you know this guy 
seems 
he's nice I I I could really we could 
talk about anything for like a long time 
and I kept thinking oh I can't make this 
date too long it's gonna it's going on 
too long I I should I okay okay dinner 
that's let's separate 
so we had we had a lovely dinner 
and then he asked me out for dessert and 
drinks 
somewhere else like let's go listen to 
some country music I'm like okay 
so we went and did that and uh and I 
thought this is going really well and 
then before the end of the night 
I find out his hobby is screenwriting 
he loves to write plays and TV shows and 
movies no wonder he's such a great 
writer and he's a bit of an introvert I 
mean it was just so fun and before the 
end of the night he asked me out on 
another date for the next weekend and 
from then on he 
closed me every day for the following 
weekend and still 
still does that still to this day and 
we've been dating now 
and we've been married 
how happy it is if you feel like you're 
still dating when you're married that's 
pretty freaking amazing 
So Married almost two years dating seven 
I love that and 
and I know that 
and 
close the loop on this what's the age 
difference between you guys is Jim 
younger than you 
no he's older he's older 
she's six years older 
So within that 10 years that you would 
you had said but he 
he would never know it by the things 
that we do 
100 and I can attest to this because as 
a very Hands-On roll my sleeves updating 
coach as you all know we're I'm in it 
with you Lindsay's in it Eileen's in it 
so when Marilyn and Jim were barely see 
like they were definitely committed we 
knew he was high GHQ they were a 
boyfriend girlfriend it was all good 
Andy and I met them for dinner 
who's gonna get my Maryland right like 
all right and I'm looking at her during 
the dinner I was like this is a keeper 
this is a keeper and we still have that 
picture of the four of us yeah from that 
dinner at summer house where just a nice 
guy good looking 
smart 
self-effacing funny he's tall he's tall 
he's tall for sure right so when she 
came up in age she got in height 
right I will always remember when we met 
at the Four Seasons writing up that list 
because everyone we all have a list of 
our guy right and over six feet was a 
must must have yeah and I'm 5'3 I mean 
you and I are about the same and you had 
said wait wait you really you want 
someone over six foot I mean is that a 
deal breaker and I'm like oh yeah I 
gotta have a tall guy God I have a tall 
guy 
and you're like well you know they all 
come in different packages 
right I mean I was willing to give it up 
but I I'm glad I didn't have to you 
didn't have to but she was very flexible 
on that I always say everybody's the 
same height lying down if you know what 
I mean that's right that's it right so 
so but she got the height gave a little 
an age and and what's so funny and I was 
telling Marilyn like what sparked me to 
have mayor on the podcast was a couple 
months ago you might remember sugar on 
the podcast who talked about finding 
love and sugar if you haven't heard that 
podcast go back and listen to how sugar 
found love she's a twin and Found Love 
with the twin but sugar said Bella you 
had an Instagram live sometime last year 
with this woman who talked about how she 
didn't want to date someone older but 
you convinced her to broaden her age 
parameters and then she met this guy and 
he brought her roses so I thought to my 
myself okay I can expand my distance and 
that's when she met the love of her life 
who ended up being outside of the 50 
miles he was from Milwaukee and so that 
sparked me I was like well if Maryland's 
story sparked sugar and you're both our 
clients then Maryland needs to come tell 
her story so Jim and Marilyn are two 
peas in a pod can't imagine it's like I 
can't imagine you guys with anybody else 
no 
assistant 
and we we have so much fun together 
there's 
and still we talk all the time once a 
month we go and see my mom in 
Mississippi and we drive and it's about 
on a good day it's a 13 hour drive on a 
not so good day it's 15 to 16 hours many 
times Bella we don't even turn the radio 
on we're just talking about our business 
we're talking about our work we're 
talking about what do we want to do as a 
couple we're doing a couples retreat 
next year I'm super excited with an 
another my best friend and her husband 
and 
she has even said you know seeing you 
with Jim this is my best friend of since 
College 
has really changed my marriage with my 
husband oh 
I have Goosebumps so I love that you 
know you just you keep paying it forward 
paying it backwards spreading that 
energy to as many people as you can you 
you don't think you know your best 
friend 
needs your help but then we do things 
with them all the time they're coming to 
stay with us in Key West in a few weeks 
I mean we have a great time that has 
fundamentally changed 
how her and her husband interact and her 
husband says I'm so grateful you met Jim 
he's so fun and we have so much more fun 
now so 
everybody loves Jim they're like uh is 
Jim coming 
I'm like wait I'm coming what doesn't 
that count what about Jim is he coming 
like all the guys they want to hang out 
with Jim everybody loves Jim Jim's like 
a guy's guy but he's also sensitive and 
funny and committed to personal growth 
and just super lovely and I love that 
about the two of you and I loved 
um being invited to your engagement 
party and bringing you that gargantuan 
bottle of champagne I just 
because it was such a Monumental thing 
to me like you it's like you found big 
love so you need a big champagne 
it's awesome we had a lot of champagne 
that night and then being able to get 
married in Key West and share that with 
everyone virtually right we couldn't 
have very many people there but we did 
do a live stream I was there and it was 
so fun yeah there was probably I think 
we had 128 people online on live it was 
amazing it was amazing and beautiful and 
I still have the photos in my camera 
maybe if I can get it together we'll put 
a page up on about Maryland on our 
website and all the fun things she does 
and she's a coach too so she does she's 
if you were gonna have a life coach I 
couldn't recommend anybody more highly 
than you because you're amazing you're 
amazing listen I am a huge believer in 
coaching right I mean let's spin back to 
what you said about 
how this had a ripple effect in my life 
I remember sending you an email about 
the ROI yeah oh talk about that I forgot 
about that because uh you back in the 
day 
you're pretty smart chick when it comes 
to finance you you've got a good solid 
background before you ever came to this 
and I thought I want to tell her because 
it took me a while to pull the trigger 
on this because I had to save up the 
money I was a single mom I was an admin 
my ex-husband did not pay me any child 
support like I could have easily taken 
all the victim mindset and just poured 
it onto myself and I was not gonna do 
that and so I remember when I we got our 
bonus at work I got my income tax return 
I haven't gotten a refund since I got 
married I just will tell you that is the 
one downfall 
but back then as the head of house all 
in as a single mom I did get a refund 
and I put all that together 
and I said you know I know I'm your 
friend but I want to pay you like I 
would be a regular client how much is it 
and it was a lot it was a lot to me at 
that time and I remember writing those 
those checks to you I wrote you two 
checks and I thought oh my God am I this 
is crazy but I want to do this I want to 
do it right I want to do it right for 
myself I want to do it right for my kids 
and I'm in a different place and I need 
this 
and so I hired you and 
I dug into the photo shoot and I 
straightened my hair and I I met with a 
stylist you know I still use 
Annie Francis as my stylist we will meet 
up 
twice a year and she helps me put 
together 
a wardrobe for the season she's amazing 
and I 
started showing up differently at work 
I went to a personal development 
conference through Brendan burchard in 
LA 
and I came back from that and I was on 
fire 
and you were coaching me and I was 
dating and I started to have the 
confidence to ask for projects at work 
you know I don't know why I thought you 
just do the work you have you don't ask 
for more than this 
and I started just saying hey you know 
that thing on the list that we need to 
get done this year I think maybe I could 
take a crack at it what do you I don't 
know maybe 
I'll try 
and I started to see some success 
and I thought 
what would it look like if I could get 
out of being an admin what could I even 
do 
and 
I thought well I can be a project 
manager I started researching and I 
thought I'm gonna I I'm good at projects 
and so I I started talking to people I 
worked with and I said hey do you have 
any projects you know I don't even know 
how I got what I got until I found 
someone who said 
you know actually I do we have this 
bottleneck in the system in the 
packaging system and we don't know 
why it's taking so long but we keep 
missing the deadline for packaging I'm 
like well okay uh let me go try to 
figure it out and I remember printing 
out this huge 
look like 
two giant tables was this long printed 
artwork process of all the steps and the 
gates that you had to go through and you 
know what I identified the three 
bottlenecks and it was human error 
transposing the UPC code 
and she said uh you want a job I'm like 
really 
and I I mean it was probably 
within six months that you and I started 
working together yeah and it was almost 
twice what I have been making 
I mean it was a significant increase 
and I remember sending you a note saying 
this is what I paid you and now this is 
what I made 
and I think this is the ROI that that 
this has impacted my life so much 
what I spent on coaching 
rippled out through everything my kids 
were doing better I was doing better I 
loved what I was doing I loved the 
people I was working with I love the 
projects I was working with 
I loved that I was bringing my best self 
that I was learning and developing and 
now 
I was starting to make more money so I 
wasn't quite paycheck to paycheck I 
wasn't having to do side hustles so much 
and it was a huge 
breakthrough for me to just have one 
person you just believed that there was 
a lid for every pot 
that you were psychotically optimistic 
and that you said I believe in you and I 
think you can do it 
oh I have Goosebumps and not only did 
you find the most amazing tall lid to 
your pot but how many I remember that 
Roi email that you sent how many job 
levels have you been promoted since we 
started together so that was 
admin to project manager 
one to senior project manager two 
to Global manager 
three to now senior Global manager for 
amazing amazing well that probably 
requires another large jug of champagne 
in and of itself it will share at a 
certain point so 
um so if you if 
our dear listener out there is wondering 
could I ever find the lid to my pot what 
would you tell them 
I mean 
first I would say if you haven't found 
it yet 
maybe your secret sauce is hiring a 
coach 
um right that's uh 
that has a process I mean the one thing 
that I loved about working with you is 
you didn't just come at it and say all 
right you can do it let's go you you 
took the time to invest in me and to get 
to know me and to get to know what I 
wanted and what I was about 
and then you assessed if you and I could 
work together because you don't work 
with just anyone no and then you said 
here here are some red flags that I want 
you to watch out for on your picker 
I I didn't no one had ever came to me 
with a plan like that and you had it all 
we're gonna do this and we're gonna do 
this and this is next and this is what 
you're looking for and 
I'm like I'm in I am all 100 in because 
I started to see results and I still go 
back to that and even with my 
girlfriends many of whom are still 
single and I've said and you've met some 
of them at my engagement party still 
single beautiful 
smart 
very very 
well-connected women single 
and I think to myself how much fun has 
it been I mean I love myself too I love 
I have a great time with myself I have a 
great time with my girlfriends 
but Jim just takes it to another level 
totally well I would say 
find someone to believe in you if you 
can't believe in this dream yourself 
find someone who can hold that light for 
you until you can believe it yourself oh 
my God that gave me goosebumps 100 
and it doesn't happen right away it took 
years to find him this didn't happen in 
minutes did it 
now you didn't and even in the beginning 
you know you and I talked about it right 
after the first date I'm like 
I don't know I just I didn't have those 
butterflies I didn't have that feeling 
and you just ignored all that and you 
said did he ask you out again and I said 
well yeah he did okay did you say yes 
well yeah okay well then next like let's 
see I hate butterflies butterflies are 
bad it's anxiety and Tommy telling you 
danger Will Robinson get out butterflies 
are bad 100 so the goal of the first 
date if there's no red flags is to get 
to the second date and the goal the 
second date is 
like to get to the third date I mean I 
know people probably you did the same 
like I'm not even gonna bother telling 
you about the fourth day because it was 
good it was fine and I know you're gonna 
make me go out on the fifth date anyways 
so right I'll be back in touch in a week 
so I'm I'm so delighted for you and the 
transformation of your life and for the 
amazing 
whatever it was that whether it was God 
or the universe that put us together in 
the same room at the Chicago Tribune 
event 
although all that time ago even before 
Home Depot and the bedroom guy right so 
I'm just glad that his lack of response 
in turkey and that long plane ride home 
where you're like enough is enough I 
want someone who as you know My 
Philosophy I want someone who likes you 
just a little bit more than you like 
them and I think you have found yourself 
the perfect man 
amen to that sister 
Marilyn thank you for sharing your 
amazing story I learned things about you 
today that I had never even heard so I 
know you've inspired me I don't know I 
may need to go run a 5k right now after 
this podcast let's go jacked up on on 
good energy into Pellegrino so thank you 
for being here and 
um we I will see you in person soon and 
smart daters I hope that 
you see yourself in Maryland because I 
think when we all look inside we can all 
see ourselves in Maryland and we've all 
done the things maybe we were 17 and 18 
or maybe we were 28 or maybe we're now 
58 but like she said find someone that 
is going to believe in you and hold the 
light for you if you can't hold that 
light yourself so with that 
ping us if you need help we can be that 
light for you or ping somebody that can 
be the light for you and until next week 
I wish you all of the light and I'm 
holding that light for you whether you 
can see it or not thank you for 
listening see you next week
