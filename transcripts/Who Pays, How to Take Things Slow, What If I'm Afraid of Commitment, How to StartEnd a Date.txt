yesterday was the dating Super Bowl so 
in honor of the busiest online dating 
day of the year I am doing five more 
mini episodes 
today who pays for the date Tuesday what 
do you say to that hot stranger and how 
do you start a conversation Wednesday 
how do you take things slow so that the 
last Thursday what if I'm afraid of 
commitment and Friday will be the best 
way to start and end a date and it might 
be different than what you think so I 
can't wait to see you and I can't wait 
to hear your thoughts on this week's 
amazing mini episodes
