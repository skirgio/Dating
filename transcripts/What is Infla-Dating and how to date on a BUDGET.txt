I've been asked to talk about this term 
called inflatating inflating means 
inflation and dating it means we as 
daters are thinking about inflation as 
we're dating now why is this relevant 
well it's relevant most of us don't have 
unlimited budgets for dating or anything 
19 
of those who are dating say they're 
going on fewer dates because of 
inflation and another 14 say that they 
are concretely trying to spend less on 
dates the first thing to do is have a 
budget it makes you date smarter and it 
makes you date more deliberately and 
you're going to be more choosy about 
who's actually going to get you in 
person and get your dinero and get your 
cash
