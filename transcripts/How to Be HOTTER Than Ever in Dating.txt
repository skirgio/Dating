about what happened to you at age 50 and 
where you are now we want to hear it all 
because so many of my listeners and you 
dear listener are going to get so much 
out of her story because I sure did 
well 
um you know my life was sort of humming 
along I was successful in my career I 
was pretty senior up in a media company 
um I had a lot of people reporting to me 
I was making money I was married I was 
married for 16 years we were together 
for 18 years I had twins 
um 
I was grinding really hard to keep all 
those plates spinning and to keep that 
life going 
um and to keep to stay in denial about 
um the things that weren't working 
I was like if I can just keep working 
and earning and you know prioritizing 
things moment to moment then we'll get 
through this this is but I was I was 
pretty burnt out and as a result 
um I believe I mean obviously it's it's 
a it's a virus but I got coveted 
um I got covid in August of 22 which was 
you know I was vaccinated 
um but I was working so hard I was 
grinding so hard so hard and so 
successful like you're being very humble 
right now you were like Queen of the 
world 
I really uh quote unquote had it all you 
did um you know on paper things look 
really amazing 
um but in reality I was anxious stressed 
exhausted miserable the marriage was not 
working 
um and I got kovid and I worked 
through the first week of it because I 
was working from home as it's so easy to 
do you're like I'll just go on that 
conference call it doesn't matter 
exactly let me just let's just take some 
Dayquil and see if we can get through 
this 
um I could not 
um I got covered pneumonia and I went to 
the hospital and they were like come 
right this way they checked me right in 
um because I really wasn't well and I 
needed intervention 
um and I wasn't on like you know I 
wasn't intubated it wasn't any of that 
stuff but they gave me all the hardcore 
things that they knew how to do for 
someone who was vaccinated and young and 
um and they put me in a in a single room 
and that room felt to me like Canyon 
Ranch 
what that's when you know 
things need to get better yeah totally I 
was like in a hospital room in isolation 
in isolation with tubes in me and I'm 
like oh 
this is so relaxing 
literally UTF no one could justifiably 
call me and ask for anything at that 
moment in my life 
um and that was the first time that it 
happened in a decade and 
um or you know yeah my kids were about 
10. 
um and 
I think I realized kind of in that 
moment in my life sometimes illness does 
something for you you know and it really 
gave me kind of a cosmic reality check 
and I came home from the hospital 
my husband was so stressed at having to 
take care of the kids by himself for 48 
hours I was really only in the hospital 
for 48 hours of like you know Rendezvous 
and all the awful things that you hear 
about all the medicines and steroids and 
everything but they got me to a place 
where I was good enough to go home yeah 
and he was pissed 
um because 
I think he started to Envision what his 
life would be like as a single parent 
and it scared the [ __ ] out of him 
um sorry I like to curse I hope that's 
fine you're like harbinger of things to 
come sir yeah 
um 
so you know when we had not been getting 
along very well and we had not had sex 
in a decade 
um and we had had all kinds of ups and 
downs and bumps in the road and 
um 
you know I had some really profound 
Revelations about 
you know how my marriage was going how 
my life was going how devoted I was to 
work 
where I was putting work in relation to 
my priorities in my life and I put it 
above everything else because it was the 
only place where I was feeling making me 
feel good about myself yeah 
um like and I had you know some 
Revelations about how brief life can be 
and how limited our time here on planet 
Earth 
is and you know as our mutual friend 
Sherry Salata 
um once asked me you know how much time 
you think you have left 
and I was like oh man like I don't know 
this is the first time I'd ever 
confronted my mortality and 
really had a chance to take stock of 
like where am I today and what is what 
have I been telling myself is okay and 
what is actually okay and what do I want 
and do I want more of this 
and the answer was just a big profound 
[ __ ] no yeah 
um so you know 
we we decided to go to couples 
counseling for the fifth time and we 
agreed that if it didn't work if it 
didn't help us 
um we would you know we would make a 
change and 
Miracle of Miracles my husband agreed to 
move out 
um and I started to come back to myself 
and then I got laid off 
oh boom boom boom so you're near 
deathbed 48 Hours light bulb goes off 
you come home you're like none of this 
is working for me except work is great 
and then 
husband moves out and then work 
Chernobyl goes away 
goes away 
and the one thing that was keeping you 
like okay and as what working women work 
you put more in you get more out a lot 
of the times fuels our self-esteem you 
do more bigger paycheck lather rinse 
repeat exactly exactly and I knew how to 
be successful because I've been doing 
I've been working hard in my 
professional life for 20 years it was a 
thing that I made for myself from 
nothing right my career yeah um and it 
was the only thing I felt I had any 
agency over and I didn't because when 
you work for someone else you can get 
laid off at any time it turns out 
absolutely so 
um I decided to go on a retreat uh in 
Italy 
with Sherry 
uh and 
um I spent a week there kind of 
envisioning what my life could be 
um if I had a chance to start over which 
it was looking like I did I had a clean 
slate 
um so I went on a retreat for a week 
um 
before that I had started dating a 
little bit and I'll talk to you a little 
bit about that not a conventional 
approach 
I met a hot french guy in Rome 
um I was there so I did a week on The 
Retreat and a week in Rome by myself 
and uh you know went on the apps in Rome 
french guy and spent spent a few days 
with him 
um and you know came back and sort of 
started to reinvent everything started 
to put plans in place to create the 
podcast that I now do called hotter than 
ever 
um where I really talk about the 
unconscious rules that we've been 
following in our lives and identifying 
those and how we can break those rules 
and find a new path to being Freer and 
happier and sexier and more 
self-expressed 
um so that's that's really what I 
started to conceive when I was in Italy 
um 
and I also realized that I you know I 
really had some um 
some years of like love and sex and 
um sensuality to reclaim 
um and so when I got back I went on what 
I call my dating rum Springer dying 
laughing tell everybody what a rum 
Springer is from Spring is when the 
Amish kids are let out of the community 
to see what the real world is like for a 
couple years before they decide to come 
back or not come back and commit to the 
Amish lifestyle so they go buck wild 
wild yeah 
is there rum Springers with the Amish I 
think so I think it's like I think it's 
a year maybe okay a couple years but it 
lets you out of the gate yeah you come 
home so right exactly so 
um I really just set out to see what I 
was missing in the world 
um and I really worked to reconnect with 
myself 
um in a thousand different ways 
um and one of those profound a profound 
way for me was sexually and so you know 
I had a lot of lovers I had lovers 
multiple lovers at the same time not at 
this not on the same night but I was 
like dating different guys 
um and only thing with different guys 
sleeping with different guys yeah 100 
just call it out oh yeah I mean it was 
great I'm happy to call it out it was 
great fun and what I what I was 
practicing during that time period was 
like what do I like what feels good to 
me who feels good to me what what kind 
of dynamic is appealing to me 
um I was also practicing boundaries 
telling people the truth telling men 
what I liked and what I didn't like how 
they could treat me and how they 
shouldn't treat me 
um and and being totally honest because 
I think I lied a lot in order to keep my 
marriage alive I pretended that I wanted 
things that I didn't want I pretended I 
was okay with things I wasn't okay with 
because I couldn't conceive of raising 
children by myself when they were 
younger 
well and I'm guessing families of origin 
can also lend a hand do you think yeah 
just taking a little stab at it at not 
knowing how to navigate conflict not 
knowing how to use your voice right 
absolutely all of the fear that we come 
to this with absolutely and fear of you 
know what if if I really say 
what I think and what I feel how does 
this marriage 
persist 
yeah um because what was I what I was 
invested in was the status quo 
I was invested in you know we're a 
couple with two kids and two careers and 
we have this lifestyle and we you know 
and we're creative people and we do you 
know we have I have this whole narrative 
about who we were and it was all 
external 
because what was happening in inside the 
relationship was not functional no 
um and we weren't you know we weren't 
happily co-parenting and we weren't 
there for each other we were adversaries 
more than we were partners and I didn't 
admit to any of that until after he 
moved out 
um none of that became really clear and 
so you know using all of these sexy guys 
as an opportunity to you know really 
find out 
who I now am 
um because when you get married in your 
early 30s 
like I was looking for kids like I was 
looking to have kids we got married when 
I was 34. 
and I'd get pregnant until I was 38 so 
like I was against a clock I felt like 
and what I wanted out of marriage was 
children 
um I did not know how to conceive of 
love in a healthy way 
and that's what so many women do you 
know between the age bracket of 32 and 
44 right we work with a ton of women in 
that age bracket and the risk is is our 
ovaries and our uterus take precedence 
the partner that we're choosing because 
the ends justify the means right I want 
kids and I'm going to jump out of the 
game of musical chairs now and even 
though I think there's a lot of red 
flags here there were right there's 
always red flags right we dust them 
under the rug under that beautiful 
antique oriental rug that you know and 
we do that and then all of a sudden 
we're like wow maybe kids will bring us 
closer together and voila they never 
ever ever do 
they did it in the beginning for us 
because when you have twins you're like 
in an emergency all the time right you 
know and we were really he was very 
Hands-On which I don't think he would 
have been with one kid 
um you know we were all hands on deck 
and it was like a crisis yeah until they 
started to have personalities and they 
were harder to manage and all the 
interpersonal stuff that we were 
challenged by in our relationship with 
each other became a challenge in our you 
know parenting the kids together and so 
you know I feel like I've come through 
on the other side of this thing with a 
new vision for my career with a new 
vision for 
um what I want my life to look like 
um and being having the freedom to make 
decisions on my own that come from my my 
desires as a woman who is about to turn 
52 as opposed to my desires when I was 
younger and I was needing to build 
everything from scratch right like I 
have a career I have self-esteem I have 
my children I have a home I have some 
more resources internally and externally 
um and now I get to invent my life 
from this place what do I want the back 
half to look like 
um and so that's what I talk about on my 
podcast I try to get insight from other 
people about how they're doing it 
um I love to hear about people's pivots 
and how they've made radical changes I 
love to hear about people finding love 
and relationship doing things 
conventionally and unconventionally 
um I love to talk about sex it's my 
favorite thing 
um so 
um you know that's where it's at I dated 
a billion guys I happened to find 
someone who I really like and we've been 
dating for like seven or eight months 
who knows what this will be 
who knows but for today 
he's a sweetheart he treats me really 
well he's hot 
he's younger really he's 10 years 
younger yeah 
um he's a former Marine you know I mean 
he's a very different kind of guy than 
anyone I've ever dated and it turns out 
that's working for me 
but I would never I would never have 
gone out into the world looking for him 
no and he just came through was he one 
of the members of the Rumspringa 
absolutely he was okay yeah he was 
stands out 
I was just so hot for him honestly it's 
like I went backwards you know you would 
not give me the he would not approve of 
my Approach Bella 
you're like this is so good we got it we 
gotta slim it down and so oh well after 
like two or three weeks I was like I 
don't really want to see anyone else and 
he's like yeah I don't either and I was 
like okay okay then I had to call all 
the other guys and be like I actually 
want to give this other guy a shot like 
you know and they're all honestly 
like the feedback from those guys was 
like good for you good for you yeah 
because I think everyone 
wants a special person in their lives 
even these [ __ ] dudes that I found 
you know even they we had very Human 
Relationships it was not superficial 
um because I'm not superficial and I 
wasn't treating it that way so these 
guys were really nice and they were like 
well I wish you the best of luck I hope 
it works out for you sweetheart 
right and so even though you knew you 
needed to sort of just sow your oats to 
some extent absolutely you were in a 
sexless marriage for a decade right yes 
I'm still making up for that you're 
making up for that forever 
you're making up for lost time and 
what's what I find lovely about it is 
you went into it intentionally right A 
lot of times and you you know and you 
invite you and I have had chats about 
this like at Smart dating we talk about 
sex exclusivity right because our 
clients are coming in in a different 
place right they're saying I've rum 
springerd I've done all of the things I 
am now ready for the lid to my pot so 
we're like okay let's prevent 
prematurely bonding to somebody that 
have red flags that might not want a 
serious relationship right so they're in 
a different quadrant to some 100 where 
you came from and and so I think that 
there's something for everybody you have 
to have those conversations dear 
listener with you and put the mirror 
Inward and say what do I really want 
right now and so I'm really glad that 
you did something that was so good for 
you and you glow and through that 
healing of finding a bunch of guys that 
were nice it's not like you had a bunch 
of jackasses no they were really nice 
and we had real some I'm friends with to 
this day and you know our conversations 
are flirty but like you know we we care 
about each other and we were empathetic 
to each other it was a number of them 
were in a similar boat to me you know 
had been in unhappy relationships we're 
trying to figure out what they were up 
to in the world you know we're 
reconnecting with themselves sexually in 
their own desires like it's not just 
women you know guys go through stuff too 
and and reassess what they want out of 
life 
um so that was a learning experience for 
me as well just to make friends with 
you know a bunch of these horny Jews 
laughs 
right and it's like you know maybe if 
your car tire went flat at three in the 
morning you could call on one of them if 
they left the neighborhood like your 
relationship is like okay it's cordial 
it's nice and you went into it 
clear-headedly on both sides it's not 
honest it's like hey I'm looking for you 
know the lid in my pot right now you're 
like hey I'm about to have fun something 
I want some fun and I want something 
light and neither of you got too 
attached to the outcomes and the outcome 
was just let's be friends let's have 
good sex let's hang out so coming into 
it with that intentionality everybody's 
got to know where they're at so if 
you're a smart dater listening to this 
remember you're here because you're 
looking for the lid to your pot so don't 
say Hey 
you can you like you've got the steering 
wheel of your life you just have to 
think about what do I consciously want 
and need right now 
yeah and that's it 
for sure for sure and I think I think 
there are a number of things that you 
can do to be hotter than ever 
um let's go there let's totally 
unqualified person to give advice other 
than my own life experience and you know 
my own observations and personal wisdom 
and what I've gleaned from the people 
I've been talking to 
um I mean first and foremost it's an 
inside job 
go there it is not about 
you know your facelift or your weight 
loss or your Brazilian or whatever no 
all of those things can play a part if 
you want them to 
um but at the end of the day it's an 
inside job and you can make yourself 
magnetic and attract the life you want 
if you clear out all the gunk 
that is in the way 
and get really clear about what you want 
your life to look like and I think the 
first step to that is to just take an 
honest assessment of your life 
you know how do you do that can you give 
us like a framework I think everybody's 
got Gunk whether you're single whether 
you're in a relationship I think 
everybody's got stuff it's part of Being 
Human so if you're talking about it's an 
inside job like what do you tell people 
to do like where am I happy in my life 
and where am I not happy or yeah where 
are those little Pinchy pain points that 
you gloss over 
right those things where you feel it in 
your body 
that you know you're saying something 
that isn't true 
or you're placating someone 
or you're doing something on a regular 
basis that makes you feel exhausted 
you know your body the truth lives in 
your body and I've long been someone who 
wanted to like just live in my head 
um and in this period of my life I'm 
much more integrated between my physical 
self and my external you know and the 
and the intellectual piece of me right 
so one thing that really helped me to 
cultivate this willingness to be honest 
and invite change is to go Within 
meditation 
prayer nature journaling 
um you know get in touch with the cosmic 
forces get in touch with that quiet 
Universal place inside yourself I am not 
a woo-woo person I am not going to tell 
you to get crystals and burn sage and 
read your horoscope 
but I do think there is 
there is a Stillness and a confidence 
and a calm and a grounding 
that is possible if you cultivate 
regular practices of just quiet and 
introspection 
I'm a big believer in writing I am a big 
believer in like journaling clears stuff 
out 
leave it on the page you know then go 
and live your life yeah and I think if 
you start to cultivate honesty in 
yourself 
and cultivate a willingness to invite 
change as opposed to resisting change 
if you allow yourself to redefine who 
you are today and Center what is 
important to you now 
like that there's some excavation to do 
to get to that I think for a lot of 
people who've built up a complex life 
structure and partnership and parenting 
and career 
but 
there's always things we're tolerating 
yes in life you know whether it's that 
like sticky door handle that's been 
sticky for 20 years 
like that takes stress that causes 
stress that's a pain point 
you can resolve the smaller ones and 
check those off your list and then start 
to look at the bigger ones you know what 
do you wish you could change but you 
think you can't because you can you can 
it might not be easy 
um but like I the lie I told myself is 
that I could be happy in a marriage 
without sex 
like that's one of a thousand but I 
literally said to my best friend at one 
point I was like you know so we don't 
have sex but we're like you know we're 
really close and we're co-parenting and 
like that's not important but she's 
known me she knew me before I get 
married 
she's like um hey liar 
but she didn't say that because she 
prioritized staying in a friendship with 
me and being there to support me 
um while I lied to myself yeah she's 
like hey 
it might be important to you like Let's 
do let's dig deep 
yeah and I know the person in the 
beginning though she was like 
sure totally 
you know she she totally knew I was 
lying and she but she didn't want to 
call me out she didn't want to make me 
feel ashamed she just wanted to be there 
for me 
you guys something came to mind and this 
is an exercise that I've maybe given to 
you on this podcast before but it rings 
true with based on what what Aaron is 
saying sit down and as you journal and 
get still make a list of all of the 
things in your life that you tolerate 
and I challenge you to have less than 
50. 
there is a whole boatload of stuff from 
the sticky door knob to you know the the 
button on your robe that's been missing 
for two years to your squeaky breaks to 
your lack of love to all of the things 
in your life that you tolerate sit down 
get quiet 
put some quiet music on or just sit in 
silence and make a list of all of those 
things that you can that you are 
tolerating and immediately then go 
through that list and look at it and 
highlight the things that you can change 
right now what is the stuff that you can 
bring to the tailor what's the stuff 
that you need to get to the Goodwill 
what's that you need to take your car to 
the mechanic just every one of those 
things acknowledging them and fixing 
them will free up energy 
by a logarithmic Factor you'll be 
shocked at oh my God I feel so much 
better so you couldn't be more right I 
love what you're saying about this being 
an inside job and really getting still 
and looking at what you're tolerating so 
make that list let me know what's on 
that list and how things have gone we 
want to know but I'm telling you do this 
stuff it works don't just sit there and 
go yeah wow that sounds good get a piece 
of paper out people listeners and do 
this 
yeah I mean it's oh my God I'm such a 
goody two shoes I love an assignment so 
you know I I'm gonna go and do that 
after this after our conversation 
because there's always stuff to clean up 
always there's also always relationships 
in your life that aren't serving you you 
know and that group of people who you 
like think you need to be friends with 
but you actually don't feel good around 
you know or those people that you've 
been attracted to you've not let 
yourself say yes to the party invitation 
like you can make different choices you 
can and and you know what people might 
think you're nuts 
people might think oh my God what are 
you doing I mean I definitely had to 
before I launched the podcast and 
decided to be a more 
uh self-expressed person you know I sat 
behind a corporate title for 20 years 
and carried the party line 
and was a great evangelist for the 
products and services that I was 
promoting 
um and I was great at convincing people 
to do things on behalf of a corporation 
but when you when it comes to doing that 
stuff for yourself it feels risky it 
feels scary it feels like oh my God am I 
Really Gonna talk about this stuff 
publicly and for me it's what I'm called 
to do it's what I'm called to do and to 
ignore that call 
is to live a less self-expressed less 
fulfilled less happy joyous and free 
life and all I want now is a happy 
joyous and free life I love that I love 
that and tell us more about hotter than 
ever in our own Journeys like what else 
can we do I love the inside job I love 
listening to your calling and if you get 
still all of that what else in your yeah 
Sage wisdom are hotter than ever Yoda 
tell us 
take extraordinary care of yourself 
the times in my life when I have 
attracted 
partners and love into my life were the 
times that I've been taking the best 
care of myself 
so treat yourself like someone you love 
and admire 
treat yourself like you would treat 
someone who you adore 
and that means spoiling yourself with 
self-care 
whether that's therapy or working on how 
you talk to yourself inside of your head 
there's a constant radio station playing 
the hits 
playing the criticisms like playing the 
what do you see when you look in the 
mirror what do you hear when you listen 
to yourself talk like you know how do 
you feel when you're around your parents 
like 
just you know do You Hear The Echoes of 
their critiques of you from your 
childhood like tune in and re-program 
give yourself some replacement language 
for how you talk about yourself to 
yourself 
um and then also like 
you know get a facial get your nails 
done blow out your hair go through your 
clothes wear things that make you feel 
sexy every morning I think to myself am 
I gonna feel hot in this might I feel 
sexy and good in the way that I'm 
presenting myself in the world who do I 
want to show up as in my life 
eat healthy delicious food eat the 
things that you love that make you feel 
good exercise you know put on lotion 
like I would deny myself even lotion 
when I was working hard I wouldn't have 
time 
I didn't I would tell myself I didn't 
have time but guess what you have time 
for what you believe you have time for 
and you do you have time for the things 
you care about 
like you do the things you care about so 
if you care about you 
you're going to do the things that help 
you take care of you and it's really 
hard when you're a working mom and 
you've got a house to maintain and 
you've got children's lives to manage 
and you've got a career and a boss and 
you've got a team working for you and 
you've got to this and you've got to 
that but the better care you take of 
yourself the more you tell the world how 
to treat you 
absolutely and just a little side note 
even when you are the boss 
right yo especially when you are I think 
it's even harder you know where you're 
you're 
you know if you're a good boss you're 
taking care of your team 
it's just another position in your life 
where you're responsible for other 
people's well-being 
100 
you know where are you in all of that 
where are you and why do you fall to the 
bottom of the list 
a lot of the time that was my experience 
I fell to the bottom of the list I had 
time for work and taking care of my kids 
my friendships fell out 
my marriage I you know was unhappy so I 
didn't prioritize us dating each other 
caring for each other I mean I did 
on the surface but I was pretending 
I was pretending yeah oh I know and you 
know it's so interesting I love 
everything you're saying and I feel like 
when I personally don't take good care 
of myself and I do things that give me 
joy because you're right I'm taking care 
of a company team I'm taking care of my 
domestic team my husband my teenagers my 
your clients my 100 clients at any given 
time and 
and I find that I can find solace in bad 
food right and it's like really sure the 
day right and it's like I'm going to say 
oh I'm not going to eat processed food 
today I'm going to be really good and by 
the time it's 7 38 p.m and the day has 
just given you a hundred paper cuts 
those chocolate chip cookies look really 
good and I realize it's probably pretty 
benign on you know things that you could 
be doing to yourself but it's like you 
want that instant dopamine hit and but 
it's like crack it feels really good for 
five minutes and then it feels like crap 
two hours later so it's really thinking 
what's gonna really make me feel good 
not just in this moment but what's going 
to make me feel good in four hours and I 
have to really help myself think in that 
way I don't know if you share that 
I mean I have struggled with 
um compulsive eating and have been in 
12-step program for that 
um and so food is like a huge issue and 
it's I talk about food and body image on 
my on my podcast I have it too you know 
I think women really struggle 
um I don't I know almost no one who 
doesn't have some sort of story going on 
about their food and their body 
um and their worthiness as it's 
connected to those things 
um and so for me sometimes 
you know I know that if I eat two salads 
a day that is when I feel the best I 
don't eat two salads a day I know I know 
I know that feels really good but I also 
know that bread and butter is awesome 
and so is frozen yogurt you know and so 
like you know we're a very small cup of 
ice cream I allow myself that which I 
you know I have problems with sugar I 
shouldn't do that but I also now I'm in 
a place where I feel like 
maybe I can come back to this and try 
moderation I don't know that's an 
experiment that is probably doomed to 
failure but for me 
um because if it's not an option it's 
not a problem usually 
um but that's a that's a whole other 
conversation 
um but I would just say like listen to 
how you're talking to yourself about how 
you eat 
you know because if you're like [ __ ] it 
I'm just gonna eat this this [ __ ] and it 
doesn't matter and I already made it 
right now I need it right now like that 
how did you get in my head and as we all 
have that little bat that Gremlin we all 
have that Gremlin right now if if you 
are more centered and more connected to 
yourself and not pushing through and 
running over things in your life and you 
are able to be a little bit more in the 
moment which is certainly what I aspire 
to you know from now until the day I die 
is not dwell too much in the past and 
not project too much about the future 
and try to be right here now 
um 
that it's a little easier right all 
those conversations are easier because 
you can hear them 
um but sometimes you're on automatic 
pilot you know 
um so to me it's about how do I get off 
automatic pilot and make conscious 
choices in every area of my life and 
that comes back down to being able to be 
still and get back to that place because 
if the monkey brain continues to run the 
show right hello cookies and donuts then 
hello yeah hi nice to meet you again I'm 
Bella your best friend right remember no 
sugar crash yeah oh my gosh one yeah 100 
and so yes that conscious mind you know 
is there any any last gem that you want 
to leave us with Aaron hotter than other 
things two gems oh wow 
two more things so 
as part of that going within and you 
know taking an honest assessment of your 
life 
identify your dreams 
and take action towards them your 
professional dreams your lifestyle 
dreams your Romantic Dreams it does not 
matter 
the how is not our job 
the job for us is to identify the what 
what is it that I want I want what do 
you want what do you want words a 
hundred percent and we were all raised 
by Oprah 
um you know and Oprah says the thing 
that the successful people she knows 
have in common is that they know what 
they want 
they have identified what they want 
because the second you know what you 
want the universe universe steps into 
alignment 
I really believe that I am not a cosmic 
woo-woo girl in in a like 
in the California kind of way 
um which is where I live 
um but I do believe in the Law of 
Attraction and I do believe that the 
clearer we are 
the more the universe will give you what 
you want 
you know here's an analogy to your point 
that I give my clients like you know 
when you're looking for something you 
see it said if I told you Aaron walk 
into a cocktail party and tell me all of 
the people that are wearing red you 
would dutifully come back with the 
little pad and say okay 11 people were 
wearing red then I'll ask you how many 
people were wearing purple and you're 
like no idea I was only looking for red 
perfect so and so to your point when you 
know what you want and you have that 
conversation with yourself do you know 
what starts to happen right the universe 
seems to move 
partly because you're seeing the things 
that you want and you are able to go get 
them because when we're in our gloom and 
doom when you're looking for red instead 
of purple and if purple is the happy 
thing and you're continuing to look for 
the red which you don't want this is 
what happens right so you don't need 
your Crystal you don't need your incense 
you need to go what do I want okay and 
then you'll start to see things appear 
that you've got to take action you've 
got to open the door it's not like you 
can sit there jamming your face with 
donuts or Doritos and just say wow come 
into my lap right now but no you have to 
first be able to say what do I want and 
then start to see that and then take 
first step Second Step third step that's 
how this stuff works just put your feet 
on the path you don't have to know where 
the path is 
you know how it's going to take you 
there just know that it'll take you 
there or somewhere better if you are 
super clear about it focus is a 
superpower 
um and we all have the capacity to focus 
on the things that we want and positive 
things in our lives we just don't tend 
to do that we tend to focus on the 
negatives right okay and when you when 
you do want right you know the little 
decisions that you make every day if I 
want X and I'm aware of it every day I 
should make a decision to do the thing 
that will take me closer to that versus 
farther from that every day you're 
filled with decision trees yes or no so 
know what you want people 
totally and then the last thing that I 
think we don't talk enough about is 
pleasure 
I think we don't focus on what gives us 
pleasure 
in life and part of my radical change 
has been to being has been about being 
connected to what gives me pleasure 
whether that's sensual pleasure sexual 
pleasure social pleasure who are the 
people who make me feel good when I'm 
around them be around those people even 
more you know what are the things that I 
do that make me feel good that make me 
feel connected to my senses is that 
walking in nature is that swimming you 
know is that 
um 
you know is that Spa a spa visit 
um is it you know spending time with my 
my dog like 
there are simple things and small things 
that can connect us to our senses and 
our pleasure centers 
um and 
pleasure really helps us to live in the 
moment 
and and to stay grounded in what's true 
and possible in life 
um and I will also tell everyone uh to 
buy a Hitachi which is uh a vibrator 
I will tell everyone to prioritize their 
own sexual pleasure 
um and get to know what feels good for 
you so that you can tell your partners 
what feels good for you and get more of 
the thing that feels good 
um yeah women we're not taught that no 
no and why not 
why not it's your body it's it's got 
built-in pleasure like it's already 
there you just have to access it 
um so don't be afraid of the sensual 
side of life and feeling 
um good in your own skin 
um good in your own body 
and I think that is part of what 
um prioritizing that just helps me feel 
like I I live a happy and fulfilled life 
whether I'm partnered or not you know 
whether like Prince Charming has come or 
not 
oh that is the perfect way to end this 
well 
you are amazing I have Goosebumps I 
um right who doesn't want to be hotter 
than ever and I think that really
