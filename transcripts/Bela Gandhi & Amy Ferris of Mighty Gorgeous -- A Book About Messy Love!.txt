public speaking they say is the number 
one fear of most humans and if you think 
about it why would that be a bigger fear 
than death right it's fear of rejection 
absolutely a hundred years ago uh you 
know somebody said to me what is your 
greatest fear you know I've listed like 
12 things and and he said no no it's 
only one and all those other things are 
born out of that one thing why is it 
that I'm afraid to get close to you know 
somebody why is it that I choose men who 
you know I have to try to make happy 
and I realized you know after like doing 
this incredible dive inward that I was 
afraid of Abandonment and and I could 
pinpoint why I was afraid of it and 
where it was born
