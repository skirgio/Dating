i cannot tell you how excited i am to 
give you guys the gift of kimmy selter 
who is a confidence therapist authentic 
dating strategist and an image expert 
let's dive right into this i believe 
that you have to work from the outside 
in and so what the formula speaks to 
is really three pillars 
is first working on what i call your 
style intelligence which is how you 
market yourself it's your clothes it's 
your body language it's your first 
impressions it's your energy 
then i go inward and work on your 
emotional intelligence and that's how 
you express yourself your vulnerability 
the authenticity how you really like 
show up 
and express that 
and the third pillar is your social 
intelligence and that's how you manage 
interpersonal you know relationships and 
yes that includes flirting so that's 
where flirting comes in
