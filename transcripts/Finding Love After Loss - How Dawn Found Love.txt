that's on the inside of of dawn so 
goodness you are so sweet fella thank 
you it's all real and you know I feel 
this way about you from my heart so 
feeling is mutual for sure so we were 
just talking about 
um 
screwball and peanut butter whiskey but 
I promise I will not be my dating 
squirrel ADHD self today that much Don 
tell us 
um kind of tell us about you you 
um and how you met 
the love of your life Mike just give us 
a little bit of backstory oh my goodness 
so just to give it some context Mike was 
Mike is my late husband who I lost in a 
tragic accident a few years ago but um 
but yeah there was so much to the story 
before that happened 
um tell us everything we're all ears 
well Mike Mike was amazing so I met him 
really young like I was only 17 years 
old but he was just a couple years older 
than me but I mean I don't know they say 
that sometimes you just know when you 
meet the right person well I was young 
and I knew that but I still like I knew 
that this was the man I was going to end 
up with like I don't know how you know 
that but I just did and so Mike was so 
we met in karate class isn't that funny 
so I love the 17 year old Dawn 
but just getting ready to go to college 
so I was just graduating from high 
school getting ready to go to college 
and I was in this karate class which was 
super fun I loved it and Mike had joined 
and 
I was actually dating the instructor at 
the time but we were on our way kind of 
out I was moving away it wasn't gonna 
work it wasn't going to be long term so 
um but uh so I met Mike and 
gosh number one he was so handsome and 
just but had this real quiet like real 
quiet energy and was so kind and sweet 
and 
um so I met him in the karate class 
and then I ran into him at a party 
and we just I remember our eyes kind of 
locked across the room and something 
clicked and it was magical and we talked 
and then later on we um got together and 
started dating and I went away to 
college but 
we still kept dating and I had so many 
people tell me advice like just you know 
keep your options open you're young 
you're in college you can't like settle 
on someone right this minute but I never 
doubted the fairy tale for a minute like 
this was my fairy tale and I was going 
to be with this person and we so neither 
one of us are perfect right because 
nobody's perfect but we were perfect for 
each other so like our strengths and 
weaknesses just complemented one another 
and 
we had all these big dreams and 
um he just supported anything that I 
wanted to do so 
you know and he was just the safe place 
for me he was home for me 
um 
so anyway we dated for a while because 
my dad was like you can't get married 
till you finish college and Mike went 
and asked for my hands in marriage he 
asked my dad in that old-fashioned way 
which I loved I didn't know he was doing 
it at the time 
um and my dad said yes 
uh but she has to finish college first 
so we waited out of respect for my 
family out of respect for everybody we 
waited till I graduated from college and 
then we got married and then 
um gosh it was just such a fairy tale 
for for so many reasons I mean we were 
so happy we traveled the world together 
we went everywhere together and I was an 
engineer that was my job 
and I'll never forget like 
well I so I was an engineer but I'm I 
was kind of an accidental engineer like 
that's not really me 
first of all suspend all disbelief how 
does one become an accidental engineer 
I'm telling you super humble so you're 
an engineer 
I am but I'm I anyway I I was an 
engineer and I had a good engineering 
job and uh 
but I just wasn't passionate about it 
not at all 
so I kind of knew it was in the wrong 
thing for me 
um 
because I'm an engineer but I don't like 
math like have you ever heard of such a 
thing I don't like math I love working 
with Engineers 
um they're wonderful people but uh just 
wasn't me so I so Mike and I decided to 
go to Africa on an African safari 
because I love nature I love 
um being outside I love animals and this 
was going to be our big trip before we 
had kids so we were like had this big 
trip planned and we went to Africa and I 
got off that plane 
and I was blown away like I I I still 
get goosebumps just even thinking about 
it so I got off the plane and like there 
was this wide expanse of Nature and all 
these animals and everything looked like 
it did maybe a million years ago I mean 
you hear about it you read about it in 
books you see it on TV but to like 
actually be in it was just life-changing 
for me so I knew it was life-changing 
even though I didn't know how my life 
was going to change so 
I got back to the US after this amazing 
trip like we saw elephants we saw the 
Great Migration we had you know Lions 
leopard cheetah it's all of those things 
that it's basically The Lion King if 
you've seen the movie The Lion King 
that's what it's like in Tanzania where 
I do my Safari so 
um 
so anyway I got back and I ended up 
um just writing a thank you note this is 
actually a really long story but I'll 
tell the abbreviated version so I wrote 
a thank you note to the guy who owned 
the company that 
um I went on the Safari with 
and it was a long thank you note though 
because I really like to write so I 
wrote on and on and on and he got it and 
he said thank you and then a couple of 
days later he said thank you 
um again for this thank you notes and I 
just can't stop reading it and I said oh 
well 
okay so we exchanged a few more emails 
and then he said I'd really like for you 
to work for me just kind of freelance on 
the side like would you be able would 
you be willing to write for my website 
and I said 
sure and I think I mentioned before I 
wasn't super happy with my job so I kind 
of noticed that this might be a foot in 
the door for something different 
and it was so he got what I wrote I just 
wrote about the five lodges where I 
stayed 
he got that and he said this is great he 
said the only problem is you have a very 
distinct writing style and it doesn't 
match anything else on my website so I 
really need to send you back to Africa 
for like a month and I'll pay you for it 
and I'll pay you to do it can you do 
that and I said 
yes yeah 
I don't know how I'm gonna make that 
work but basically at the end of this 
long story 
um I knew I had a job with the company 
when I got back from Africa and I 
remember talking to Mike about it and he 
was he was so supportive he's like wow 
this is your dream I said I know but I 
got to say goodbye to this 
high paying job it's an engineering job 
it's really secure he's like you have to 
go for this I mean he was so supportive 
and didn't even bat an eyelash about it 
so I did I jumped off the cliff and went 
and quit my job and went to work with 
this crazy idea with this Safari company 
selling safaris and 
um I remember 
nobody else supported me everybody 
thought I was crazy but not like the 
only the only three people in the whole 
world that thought I should do it were 
Mike and my parents my parents are like 
you go girl but I mean I could say I 
want to be an astronaut and they'd be 
like you go girl so so Mike and my 
parents and everybody else was like well 
this is adorable go get this out of your 
system and then when you're ready to 
come back to be an engineer you can do 
that and so 
um anyway I never long story short I've 
been doing it for 17 years I never went 
back 
I um it's been an amazing life and so 
Mike went to Africa with me several 
times and he was just like that with 
everything like 
we hardly I mean 
we never really fought I know some 
people might say that's bad 
like you have to have to disagreements 
but we just never really did we both 
just had a lot of empathy for each other 
and it's not that we never disagreed but 
we really really just put the other 
person first and so it was an amazing 
marriage it was an amazing life and 
um 
we were never able to have kids that was 
never in the cards for us but gosh we we 
really did have an amazing life and we 
ended up moving 
back to the little dinky Hometown where 
my family was from 
because Mike was going to help my dad 
uh Farm my dad was getting older he was 
going to retire and so Mike was going to 
help take over the farm and I could work 
from anywhere so as long as I have a 
phone and internet I can plan safaris 
from anywhere in the world 
and we were always like the Cayman 
Islands or you know this little rural 
town in the middle of nowhere and anyway 
the little rural town in the middle of 
nowhere won because that's where our 
family was and that just became our 
priority so 
so we did and 
um just never ever in a million years 
what I've seen 
what was coming down the road 
um 
so anyway I feel like I'm talking a lot 
is there anything else 
stage perfectly tell me how old were you 
now at this point 
you guys got married and you're you got 
married in your early 20s now you've 
been in African dreams Fires for 17 
years so when Mike and you came back to 
rural Kansas 
how old were you gosh I was in my 30s 
okay so probably early 30s and then we 
lived in 
the little rural Town 
um 
well I was 39. when the accident 
happened so when I said I worked for the 
Safari company for 17 years that's today 
today yeah I lost Mike back in 2016. So 
and again I mentioned not good at math 
so I don't know how old I was but I was 
in my 30s and I was 39 when 
when I lost Mike in the accident and uh 
uh so I 
it was a sudden accident of course it 
was 
um 
during my family's Harvest uh Harvest is 
a big time for wheat farmers and uh 
so Mike was just out there helping my 
family and helping my dad and uh he was 
working on a combine 
and 
it fell on him so the header fell off of 
the combine and shell on him so he was 
killed instantly he didn't suffer at all 
which was important for me to know you 
know later and uh My Poor Dad he was in 
the combine when it happened so uh he 
had to go through all of that and 
yeah that was huge I'll never forget 
when he came in the door to tell me what 
had happened like he was so strong and 
so wise and 
he basically said the three things that 
were most important to hear you know at 
the time was 
um 
it was there's been a tragedy so he told 
me the truth of what happened like he 
and he said Mike had died 
and then he said it's nobody's fault 
because it's hard to understand where 
your brain goes after that but I really 
needed to know these things in order to 
process all of the terrible grief that 
was coming down the pipeline so he told 
me that he told me what had happened in 
as few words as possible he told me it 
was nobody's fault and then he told me 
Mike didn't suffer because that was 
really important to my hearts so I um 
and then I was able to kind of process 
the rest of it but yeah it was no easy 
road so 
no easy Road I suppose like looking back 
you know 
um 
there's the grief of losing your best 
friend in the whole world and your 
husband and your future I mean the way 
you see it right 
um 
at the time and uh I mean your your 
whole your whole plan just got canceled 
so everything everything you know 
everything you know so there's that 
um and just losing that person so 
there's the grief of losing the person 
and then there's the grief of like 
losing I mean my identity was so wrapped 
up in 
Mike and me like people didn't even say 
you know Dawn people didn't say Mike 
people would be like Mike and Donald 
like we had kind of a collective title 
because we always did everything 
together and 
um so my identity was really wrapped up 
in him I think a lot of times when 
people get together and they're young I 
think they can grow apart because you're 
still not who you're gonna be right but 
we kind of just kind of grew together so 
our whole life was kind of enmeshed in 
each other and 
I mean not in an unhealthy way I don't 
think it kind of sounds that way when I 
say that but I mean we still supported 
each other very we're both very 
independent we both had our own dreams 
and goals and 
um we just supported each other in that 
so it was like this freeing thing it was 
a safe relationship but you were free to 
be whatever you wanted to be and do 
whatever you know you were meant to do 
so 
so we were tied up in that way so not 
only did I grieve was it grieving the 
loss of Mike this amazing person but I 
was also kind of grieving the loss of us 
and the life that we had so and who I 
was when I was with him I mean he really 
did bring out the best in me and 
so uh I kind of had to deal with all of 
those things and uh I just imagine Mike 
with this beautiful from the day I'm I 
first talked to you and you sent me 
pictures of him and pictures of the two 
of you for our first meeting to give me 
perspective on who you are who Mike and 
Dawn were and how you were coming 
through this tunnel on your own and 
you're right his photos just and he's so 
handsome you know like like a movie star 
as you would say and and YouTube Just 
emanated ease and joy in your photos 
easy I've heard you say that before like 
you know you're in the right 
relationship when it's easy when it's 
easy joyful 
and joyful so you 
um John has just written a great book 
and we're we're going through parts of 
this but I'm gonna say it's called the 
darkness and the stars and it'll tell 
you way more detail when I read her 
story I know the story like I know so 
many of my clients stories right it's 
sort of like okay here's the tunnel I've 
walked through and now here I am and I'm 
ready today but to read this book it's a 
beautiful 
explanation of what the days were like 
what that hour was like what she felt in 
her body and it gave me so much 
perspective and empathy for someone who 
goes through that sick trauma that 
hopefully nobody has to go through and 
and so if you know make sure I'll put a 
link in the show notes to the book but 
it's amazing and it'll tell you what 
this incredibly beautiful girl this 
strong woman went through to get here to 
tell you the story that she had as been 
through today so now let's Flash Forward 
a little bit you are in hell you 
are getting used to you you have this 
new life you've been thrust into a life 
that you did not choose and you did not 
want and at a certain point you feel and 
this must be some years ago where maybe 
you're ready to date maybe you're just 
ready to put something in the wound at 
this point what happened there to get 
you from A to B and then we'll get into 
your dating story 
yeah 
yeah so 
I mean it's there's grief is definitely 
an evolution like 
of course at the beginning of all of 
this I didn't know what I didn't know 
um and I know that everybody's 
who goes through grief their story is a 
little different and how they process 
it's going to be different I'm also 
interestingly enough and and I write 
about this in my book I mean there's a 
lot of things that are similar to you 
know a lot of the a lot of the 
the nuances are different but 
I think a lot of people going through 
grief are also United by a lot of the 
same sort of universal truths and some 
of the evolution is definitely going to 
be linked by some common thread you know 
but I say it just I say that just 
because this was my story it doesn't 
necessarily mean it's going to be the 
same for anyone else but like when my 
when I lost Mike 
there was the whole I mean I just kind 
of slipped into survival mode for a 
while yeah so you just take one day at a 
time 
but yeah losing him 
left a 
giant void like he was my best friend 
and 
um 
and and I had been with someone since 
you know I was 17. so I hadn't really 
been super single anytime as an adult so 
it was 
I didn't really like the idea you know 
if somebody said are you ready to date 
I'd be like no but at the same time I 
still had this big void 
um 
foreign 
and so I just kind of evolved I I ended 
up sort of dating someone accidentally 
we became friends first and 
then I ended up it ended up turning 
romantic and there were a lot of 
wonderful things about the relationship 
but and it did it was very uplifting I 
had this new person in my life who 
really really I felt like you saw me I 
felt 
um like he cared I felt he was filling 
in a lot of these voids but 
uh 
I was also still at a place where maybe 
I wasn't able to see some red flags over 
here on the side and uh 
and and so I was I was uh struggling a 
little bit I mean I was in this 
relationship but a few things just 
weren't quite right and 
the other person I was in the 
relationship with was wanting to take it 
to the next level and I it just didn't 
feel right in my gut and I didn't really 
know what to do I mean I would talk to 
friends and family and they would I felt 
like they were all censoring what they 
were saying you know like to kind of 
just 
um maybe they were giving me advice but 
it was always biased advice and so for 
sure 
I 
um anyway I felt like I was kind of in a 
vulnerable place and I didn't know what 
I didn't know but I did know enough to 
like not super trust my decisions at the 
time and I just needed someone to check 
me out like check check where I was let 
me bounce this off of someone and it 
just I happened to be watching Steve 
Harvey one day 
and he had Bella on and I was just kind 
of transfixed I was I don't remember 
what the episode was about I'm sure it 
was dating 
um but you were just like giving amazing 
advice and 
I was like huh I wonder who this person 
is like she seems pretty cool and you 
were a relationship coach and I was like 
I never really heard of that before but 
I mean people have coaches for other 
stuff like people have coaches for 
Fitness people have Financial coaches 
all of these other things and I've 
always put a lot of weight on like the 
person you choose to marry for example 
or the the person you choose to be with 
as your significant other because I feel 
like that permeates into all different 
kinds it's all different aspects of your 
life like 
it just takes a huge chunk so I put a 
lot of weight on that and I was like 
well why not have a relationship 
coach like it's so important it's such 
an important part of your life 
in it whether it's good or bad like if 
it's a bad if it if you're not with the 
right person it can really influence 
your life in negative ways anyway I was 
putting a lot of weight on it 
I I looked you up online and I found 
your website and I thought really like 
it's as easy as just emailing her or 
calling I think I just emailed you right 
and then we set up a time to talk 
and then I told you everything I told 
you all about my whole story we talked 
for a long time and you were so 
um 
we are such a friendly person anyway 
like it's really easy to click with you 
and I'm sure a lot of people do but I 
really did I felt like we were 
best friends from forever ago and I mean 
but but you were better than a best 
friend because you had like number one 
you were 
um 
you you were an expert like you already 
kind of knew like a lot of my friends 
were giving me advice but maybe it 
wasn't the best advice 
everybody means well but you were a 
relationship expert it wasn't your first 
rodeo and then also 
you um 
you could kind of look at it in a little 
bit 
clearer light than maybe me who was in 
the trenches and all these people around 
me giving me advice who were also kind 
of in the same trenches and so 
you just you didn't tell me what to do 
you just kind of gently guided me in the 
right direction and then after that 
phone call we agreed to like check in 
later and you just kind of let me be 
like you can't this can be some next 
steps if you decide to end this 
relationship there is a future for you 
it's not the end of the world like 
there's other things we can do 
and um 
so I did so I just kind of let the 
advice simmer I kind of let the whole 
scenario play out naturally but with a 
little bit more 
I felt a little more grounded I felt a 
little more centered 
and uh a little more confident that I 
was making the right decisions and 
that's didn't have to just be in this 
relationship because there was nobody 
else I could you know 
just keep my options open and as I was 
evolving in my grief and coming to 
Clarity a lot of these things became 
more apparent so you just kind of like 
gave me the the kick I needed to get 
where I needed to be so and I wanted I 
want to pause you right there and I want 
to make sure listeners you hear this 
that sometimes when we come into a 
relationship and we feel like huh there 
might be some red flags but I don't know 
typically what we tend to do is we'll 
keep brushing the red flags under the 
rug because we fear 
that this is the last person on Earth 
and wow I mean he's better than being 
alone or she's better than going back on 
the apps again but the resounding answer 
to that and like dawn said is wherever 
you are in your journey right now have 
hope that you don't need to settle for 
something that has red flags around it 
right there's all sorts of great 
relationships out there and there is a 
great future for you so if you're 
hanging into something that you know 
it's like Goldilocks it's like this 
chair feels a little too small or this 
chair feels a little too big you don't 
have to settle for that and so I'm so 
glad that that message 
made an impact on you that there is 
another future out there for you there 
is another mission for you should you 
choose to accept it 
right and I guess I just need it I just 
didn't see that at the time but of 
course after I talked to you I thought 
well maybe there are other 
possibilities and I hadn't even done any 
online dating yet so I this other person 
that I was in a relationship with just 
kind of happened through a friendship 
first and then anyway let one thing led 
to another and right so we were talking 
about the online dating and I um 
I 
I saw that as a way to expand my pool 
because I live in a very tiny little 
rural town in the middle of nowhere and 
I feel like I already know everybody in 
this town like I know it and so that 
brings its own anyway it's a it felt 
like a shallow dating pool 
um but we were talking about online 
dating and how you could kind of use 
that to expand your dating pool yeah and 
I also remember from Steve Harvey saying 
like if you find the right person you 
know there's really no just distance 
doesn't really matter in the end it's 
just an excuse so your soul mate is not 
gonna come from your ZIP code 
right so 
uh so so anyway but it also felt super 
intimidating because I'd already heard a 
bunch of stories about online dating and 
I'm like I don't know how to do it I 
don't want to do it and then 
um you just made it all more so much 
more manageable somehow like you said 
well this is what we'll do in 
uh it like I said it wasn't your first 
rodeo it was my first rodeo but it 
wasn't yours and so I felt like I would 
be sort of remiss to miss out on this 
opportunity to use your experience to 
kind of put my best foot forward and I 
just feel like I've been through enough 
I just had enough of the drama and the 
Heartbreak and the I just wanted 
something to 
um to be a little easier so I wanted to 
make it easy 
possible right like 
it can be hard this could 
this comes a great word like it's not 
all the serious business we make it all 
to be like let's have some fun so I 
never thought about having fun before 
terrible as that sounds like really this 
can be fun 
but uh so you made it super fun so we 
got together we um you helped me do a 
profile we did the whole photo shoot 
which was amazing you helped me know 
what to where I'm already staying to 
bring dresses and I was like oh Bella 
they've been waiting for this moment I 
love dresses she sent me no less than 25 
pictures of her in different dresses I'm 
like are you kidding me normally people 
like oh my gosh I don't have any dresses 
you're like no no no I love dresses and 
Dawn might be one out of a hundred 
people that do our photo shoots that 
didn't need to buy any new clothes at 
all because she's like I have long I 
have short I have sleeves I have no 
sleeves I have 
absolutely everything and my you know 
and and from Don's perspective it was 
that and from my perspective having been 
through these rodeos before what I know 
to be true with so many people whether 
you've come out of a you know what 
especially when you've lost a partner 
that was a very good partner the bit the 
risks that I see are you know it you 
know it's God's blessing you don't know 
in a sense what a bad relationship is 
sometimes you know you don't know what a 
red flag is and we've heard all these 
things like well marriage is work 
relationships are work so we think well 
you know I guess maybe my relationship 
with Mike was easy and maybe this is 
just going to be more work right and 
that's where we for me I want to rap and 
I wanted the minute I met John I'm like 
oh I want to wrap this girl in like 
extra sparkly extra padded pink bubble 
wrap and prevent her from any more hurt 
during this process right because 
sometimes when you've come out of 
umat Mike at 17. now you're thrust back 
into the dating World in your early 40s 
was that right well I was 39 when I lost 
him so yes I started dating I was in my 
early 40s you were in your early 40s and 
sometimes you you know it's it's funny 
it's like you know you wouldn't know a 
red flag if it hit you in the face you 
know to use an old expression right like 
we don't know because we come from 
what's good and your parents were lovely 
and so for you I think you know mission 
number one was just keeping you out of 
Harm's Way away from Red Flag people and 
not to rush into something too quickly 
because as a 17 year old you're like lid 
pot nice to meet you karate class let's 
do this right and and so now when the 
dating landscape has changed so much 
we're older now we're different people 
you're a different Dawn than you through 
this tunnel than you were back in that 
karate class right and it's like how do 
I navigate this so so you came to 
Chicago you're right we did your photo 
shoot and and I remember you asking me a 
question like Bella what's a really good 
Greek restaurant and I said oh you like 
Greek food you're like well I have the 
specific favorite food have you ever 
heard of musaka I said well yeah because 
I grew up with some people in musakas 
Lay meat and potatoes and I thought this 
a lovely girl from rural Kansas wants 
this Greek delicacy she's pretty cool 
and went out and said I had the best 
musaka I've ever had in Chicago when she 
came in for the photo shoot so now Flash 
Forward you go through our process you 
know who your next high GHQ guy is going 
to be we go through we make the list of 
your elevator people we talk about red 
flags how we're going to Pace your 
relationships you get your photos done 
you have her profile now your quote 
unquote launched online and what I 
remember is first of all covet happened 
right when you launched yourself online 
right when I did yeah that was it was 
huge bananas it was like March of 2020 
and Dawn being Dawn the Eternal 
psychotic Optimist was like oh my gosh I 
can't believe how any messages I'm 
getting and this is actually kind of fun 
and where are all these people come from 
and we're like you're beautiful and you 
have this beauty inside of you you're 
going to bring so many people to you 
regardless of how Rural and I just 
remember your mind being so blown in the 
beginning and correct me if I'm wrong 
like 
this is just fun and look at all these 
people that actually want to go out on 
dates with me I'm like you didn't think 
that's going to happen you're like Oh I 
thought that would happen so so it was 
so magical in the beginning and and you 
had lots of interest from a lot of 
different people right 
it was it was I did and I was pleasantly 
surprised like I did not know what to 
expect at all 
but I'm so glad you were there like in 
the beginning to like navigate some of 
this stuff I feel it some of the guys 
that I 
went on dates with or communicated with 
like 
I think I could write a sitcom about it 
you know like it's just there's been 
there were so many like classical 
like this guy is the player this guy is 
the anyway like you name it I like 
bumped into all these personalities and 
I feel like I'd write another book about 
that but of course I'm sure you could 
anyway 
um 
so you were kind of there to help guide 
me through 
all of that really and uh was able to 
kind of avoid some 
pitfalls I think and 
uh so and there were a few relationships 
that were just kind of difficult and you 
helped me navigate all of those it was 
so nice to have someone to talk to who 
uh you know 
kind of knew the the the dating 
landscape and kind of helped me avoid 
some of those pitfalls so that was 
invaluable and Priceless and uh 
yeah and then I 
found Matthew 
who I'm with today 
so that was uh that was that was 
interesting so Matthew was uh 
he lived about two two and a half hours 
away from where I lived 
did you all hear that two and a half 
hours away some of you were like oh this 
person's 10 miles away they're never 
gonna come two and a half hours so 
um oh I can't wait to to hear how this 
story unfolds because I've got details 
in my memory as well 
yes so 
Matthew was 
a very interesting person so I I 
remember 
um he was the opposite of boring and 
he really did catch my interest so we 
communicated a little bit uh with 
messages but one of the things I liked 
to do right away was talk to someone on 
the phone well resume wasn't really as 
big then as it is now but uh I 
definitely wanted to talk to somebody on 
the phone because I feel like you could 
learn a lot just by talking and having 
conversation 
and so and he wanted to do it right away 
like he's like I just want to talk on 
the phone and I was like oh because I 
got some resistance from people before 
they were like well you know they'd send 
another message or a text or whatever 
and 
just felt like I was kind of 
um burning some time doing that kind of 
stuff so I loved that so he wanted to 
talk on the phone and we talked on the 
phone 
for I know we were supposed to limit it 
I think like you limit your first 
conversations on the phone but I mean we 
it just naturally we just the time just 
flew by we would talk for hours on the 
phone 
and then 
uh and he was very funny he's very funny 
very outgoing 
um 
I could tell he was just a really he had 
been through a lot in his life as well 
so he also had kind of a depth and a 
capacity that I was 
attracted to and you learned that when 
you talk to someone on the phone so we 
talked on the phone a lot like a lot and 
he uh and then he wanted to meet me 
and because it was during covet it was 
hard like I didn't want this strange man 
to come to my house for the first time 
but really we were limited on where we 
could go so we just decided he lived two 
and a half hours away from where I did 
and there's this charming little town 
that's just halfway between our two 
towns and we just decided to meet there 
there's a park with a castle 
and a place to sit outside and this was 
in the spring so we just decided to have 
a picnic 
and it was such a fun first date like I 
remember the first like when we first 
met 
um 
I was still sitting in my car and he 
just pulled up and he got out and he 
like this is just Matthew like he just 
says what he thinks he's super honest 
which is you know a blessing and a curse 
sometimes but he's very honest and uh 
just said oh my gosh you are so pretty 
I was caught off guard by that because a 
lot of times people are kind of reserved 
when they first meet you or kind of you 
know it was very disarming so I just 
laughed and that was the start of the 
first date and so we got some our little 
picnic basket and I he brought the food 
and I brought the wine and we went and 
sat at a picnic table and just talked 
for hours and then we walked up in into 
the castle which was all it's a very 
simple Castle I say castle in a very 
generous way it's more like a little 
castle sounds very Grand this is it is a 
castle sort of it's more like a little 
fort that's outside that sits on top of 
a hill it's very pretty it has a great 
view but it's 
it's um quite rustic so and it's all 
it's all open 
air so we like went up to the top to 
deck and he just let me talk and talk 
and talk 
and uh 
it was and he made me laugh so much like 
I've never 
he's one of the funniest people I know 
so he would just make me laugh and he 
would tell these stories and then 
at the end of the date he was very 
respectful like such a gentleman like I 
had been on some dates where 
like I don't even know if you really 
like me like you know there's not any 
kind of uh invitation for a next date 
there's not any kind of uh 
I don't know like something affirmative 
nothing affirmative nothing to confirm 
everybody's very guarded sure he was the 
opposite of that so it was he was very 
appropriate but gave me just a very nice 
peck on the cheek you know to say 
goodbye wanted to see me again had held 
my hand for the Three Steps From The 
Castle to the car and then 
you know looking back on that kovid was 
kind of a blessing in a way because 
really you just go on a date with 
someone in a normal sit-down restaurant 
and you just talk for 
an hour or two maybe and then you go 
your separate ways but we like spent the 
whole afternoon into the evening 
together and then 
parted ways and so uh during the course 
of one of our phone conversations so the 
other thing that I didn't know at the 
time of course I know now but just to 
kind of set it up into context Matthew 
loves to cook he loves to cook he's a 
very good cook 
um but I had told him you know we would 
ask each other questions on the phone 
just getting to know each other one of 
them that came up at one point was what 
is your favorite food and I was like oh 
musaka and he was like 
what what is that 
and I said oh well you can't make it I 
said you just like when I go to new 
cities you know there's no place around 
here this serves me Saka so when I go to 
different cities I always try to find a 
Greek restaurant and then I order the 
musaka just because it's fun to see how 
it's different in different places 
um again this is that Greek dish which 
is 
um 
very complicated to make it's kind of 
like a lasagna only way worse because 
you have to cook the food like if you're 
gonna try to make it you have to cook 
the potatoes and eggplants and squash 
you don't cook it all together you cook 
it in different layers so you have to 
put it in the oven for 40 minutes take 
it back out put on another layer put it 
in the oven for 40 minutes take it back 
out put it on another and then you know 
you keep doing that and then there's 
this vegetable sauce which is like you 
need a magic trick to make it like it's 
very uh 
it's still kind of uh Voodoo to me I'm 
not even really sure so I said no no no 
because I kind of thought maybe he was 
thinking oh well maybe I'll make that 
for dinner sometime and I'm like no no 
no no you know I I didn't mean it like 
I said I also like spaghetti I also like 
pizza you know I like peanut butter and 
jelly sandwiches so so he was so little 
did I know he was making a mental note 
um so anyway on our second date we again 
we met in the same little Charming town 
that sits just between us and uh we sat 
in the we got a blanket and sat in the 
park and asked each other questions and 
I think I told you Bella we were solving 
all the problems of the world and 
figuring every everything out and just 
had very um in-depth conversations and 
then at the it was getting time to go 
find something to eat but of course our 
options were limited so 
um 
he went to so we were going to go try 
and find a sandwich shop or something 
where we could go get sandwiches and 
bring it back to the park and he's like 
no no I have a surprise for you so he 
went to the back of his car and pulled 
out this giant like plate of musaka he 
had mates he's practiced on his family 
the whole week before he had made it it 
was like his fourth time trying to make 
it because it was hard it was hard and 
he kept messing it up and so he finally 
figured it out ate the vegetable sauce 
and had this whole plate of moussaka and 
I was stunned I was floored this was 
only our second date I'm like wow he's 
definitely paying attention and he has a 
lot to try 
I remember when you called me and told 
me this and I was like okay second date 
musaka made it four times to perfect it 
I was like either this guy is bananas or 
she's gonna marry him it's one or the 
other and of course there's me are you 
at the public place 
we were we we went to a gas station and 
like heated it up in their microwave and 
then brought it back out to the park and 
had our moussaka and it was so good he 
really did a good job so that was really 
fun yeah was one of the things I really 
liked about him like he didn't really 
hold back he was very much like and 
that's just how Matthew does life right 
like he's like I know this is what I 
want and I'm gonna go after it with 
everything that I can so it's been like 
that ever since like he really does have 
he he he just lives his life with so 
much heart and so much to try and he's 
so generous and so loving and um he's 
just become my biggest cheerleader in 
the whole world like he'll he'll do I 
know that if it was him in that place 
where I'm hey I'm getting ready to quit 
my engineering job 
and go sell safaris like good luck with 
that like he would be like you go girl 
he would be that guy so that's I I kind 
of thought maybe that was a rare find 
oh he was such a rare find and I 
remember so many of our conversations in 
the beginning about things to dig deeper 
on things to ask about like what caused 
the divorce where do you want to be like 
and really through this process 
Excavating the details that are 
important to know about this person's 
past but more importantly we don't hold 
anybody's past against them but the the 
question is always what have you done to 
grow yes and what impressed me about him 
from the get-go is this is a guy that 
was invested in being the best version 
of himself and again like John saying 
Matthew and I haven't met Matthew but 
yet I feel like 
through our conversations over the last 
several few years now I feel like this 
is a person that in a good way wears his 
heart on his sleeve and he lives out 
loud and he's fiercely loyal to the 
people in his tribe and he will you know 
he's probably that guy that if your 
Tire's flat at three in the morning you 
got a short list of people who would 
come out and rescue you and Matthew 
would be that guy who's on everybody's 
list that knows him that's exactly right 
no that that ex you explained it very 
well and uh 
it and you know it was a lesson for me 
as well I mean one I kind of needed to 
learn that I didn't even really know 
that I needed to learn but I mean 
Matthew 
is very different than Mike my late 
husband I mean Mike had a lot more 
um 
uh just a different demeanor so so 
Matthew he like I said he he sees 
something and he goes after it with his 
whole heart like if he really really 
wants it he doesn't hold back he wears 
his heart on his sleeve and uh 
like in the beginning that almost felt 
like too much to me at times and I 
needed him to slow down and one of the 
really really impressive things about 
him at one point when I did kind of put 
the brakes on the car where we were 
going with the relationship and I told 
him I needed a break 
because I was still getting over a lot I 
was still dealing with a lot and all of 
a sudden have someone pursuing me like 
like like he was in talking about 
marriage already some big big life 
changes it just felt like a lot to me 
and uh so he did you know he put the 
brakes on he 
um was so respectful and 
um but but still gently pursued me uh in 
in a way that felt good to me and and I 
really admire that about him is his 
capacity to adjust and and change and 
um 
anyway it's he's coachable false yeah 
he's coachable and one of the really 
nice side benefits about 
that was that you know we were in this 
like 
I don't know in the beginning it I mean 
it was fun but it's still like this 
you're meeting someone and then you're 
kind of thrust into a romantic 
relationship with them 
and you don't have a lot of history you 
don't have a lot of background yet so 
I felt like when we took a little bit of 
a pause 
we still saw each other but just more 
casually more as friends and we would 
talk on the phone sometimes 
and that allowed us to really get some 
depth to the relationship so we became 
really really good friends like he is my 
best friend now like we became just 
amazing friends got to know each other 
even better and then 
allowed the romance to kind of take care 
of itself with that Foundation 
underneath of it and that has been the 
secret sauce for us on on making you 
know making some progress in a way that 
feels good to me because I tend to be 
more reserved I tend to be more 
um careful to a fault maybe sometimes 
and uh so in that way I feel like we 
complement one another uh and it's a 
good it's a good match and he like he's 
so creative he's so generous he's so 
wonderful and uh 
I just had to allow myself to to see all 
of those traits kind of just Bloom 
rather than um well he's not what I 
expected exactly so I'm just gonna shut 
the door you know what I mean so anyway 
it was so different he's so different 
than Mike and that happened is hard in 
the beginning it's hard it's like here's 
a man who I was with for 20 years that 
had a quiet confidence right that was 
just peaceful and maybe emerged from a 
room a day later with the solution and 
you didn't know he was working on it and 
then juxtaposed and Mike loved you 
fiercely and was your biggest 
cheerleader and now to go to a 
personality with somebody who will you 
know bust down walls for you and has a 
confidence that may not be quite as 
quiet but assertive in a sense so just 
the personality differences to navigate 
that and when you have lost someone you 
love and I can only imagine to accept 
somebody who's different is hard 
yeah it was hard and I had to allow 
myself time and space to evolve to that 
place where I could do it but I'm so 
glad that I also have the capacity to 
change and evolve and we've really 
evolved together in this relationship 
and it feels really good now and so and 
I realized a lot of that had to do with 
me like looking back a lot of it had to 
do with me and like being in a place 
where I needed to be in order to take a 
step forward 
absolutely and you guys know the 
research shows that in heterosexual 
relationships at least men can fall in 
love harder and faster than women right 
and and so it doesn't but yeah yeah and 
it doesn't necessarily mean oh my gosh 
is he a narcissist does he love bombing 
he's declaring his love for me right 
away it just means okay 
with that being said if this person is 
moving faster than you want more 
assertively than you want then the 
litmus test it's not that the litmus 
test for is this person a good partner 
for you is how do they respond to you 
putting the brakes on do they have a 
hissy fit and a tantrum and say you're 
losing out on the best thing that's ever 
happened to you or do they say it's okay 
I understand it might hurt but let's do 
this on your terms I'll wait and that is 
always the litmus tester just because 
somebody comes out of the gate making 
you musaka in the back seat on the 
second date you might go oh my God Don 
was being love bombed not necessarily 
and this is the beauty 
of time through the process there is no 
substitute in the dating and 
relationship process for one commodity 
and that's time yeah and I remember you 
saying that to me several times yeah 
yeah and letting something breathe hell 
we train for marathons for eight months 
we let a bottle of wine breathe for an 
hour but with relationships we want to 
know right now is it gonna work is it 
right is it left it's like hold on let's 
just see what happens step by step by 
step and for you listening to yourself 
yeah and being okay and I remember fully 
supporting and in fact advocating to 
pull the push the brakes pump the brakes 
this is a good man he just he 
you have to do things at a rate that 
you're comfortable at yeah and that's 
part of my nature and it's also where I 
was in my sort of evolving out of my 
grief process and transitioning into a 
brand new life like that was huge and I 
really just needed to go at my pace and 
so everything you said is spot on about 
giving it time 
and that's and he allowed me to do that 
which I I agree is a great litmus test 
you know he could have uh moved on 
quickly but he did not do that he did 
not and nor did you and open 
communication from a place of love 
that's honest right is what in a sense 
keeps I call it the relationship 
container it keeps the container clean 
you always want to wipe the lint out of 
the container never let the dirt build 
up in that and being open and honest 
where you are these These are the tests 
of is somebody going to be a good 
partner for you if they don't agree to 
pump the brakes on in the beginning what 
are they going to be like 10 years down 
the road right right if you're not 
willing to respect a wish like can we 
talk on the phone first and like you 
were saying you were getting friction 
from God well I just really like to meet 
that shows you who this person is are 
they flexible are they willing to say 
okay sure I'd meet you halfway yeah 
let's talk on the phone I'd love to meet 
but that's a great idea let's do it this 
way these are all little kicks to the 
tire of a used car that you want to buy 
maybe that's not the best metaphor but 
you know what I mean and it's like yeah 
you're giving this person you're you're 
seeing how could we navigate the 
differences in between us right because 
as easy as a relationship could be 
between you and Mike or you and Matthew 
or me and Andy for example that doesn't 
mean it's conflict-free it doesn't mean 
it's friction free ever it means and if 
we're in relationships where we feel 
like wow you know it's just it's easy we 
never fight you and Mike oh knew each 
other well enough that you'd be like I'm 
gonna give in to this because I know 
this is really going to make her happy 
and give him but that's not not using 
your voice that's you know the other 
person you know yourself that is 
surprising your boundaries right and so 
conflict in even the most beautiful 
relationships still exists conflict 
exists when you put any two human beings 
together for a long enough time yeah 
family members children Spa houses step 
children colleagues it happens but what 
do you do how do you navigate through 
that conflict and what you and Matthew 
were able to do is navigate those 
differences in where you were in the 
relationship to the point where you 
could both accept the other person and 
meet each other 
when and where you were ready so now 
flash forward to 
this engagement that happened in a very 
special place tell us tell us the second 
lid to your pot musaka Matthew what 
happened well 
so we decided 
um 
I I just wanted to go to Paris I mean 
really I wanted to go to Paris uh had 
nothing to do with an engagement or 
anything like that 
um 
but he fully supported a trip to Paris 
anyway one thing led to another 
and he took me to Paris Last Summer 
and 
man Matthew does big gestures really 
well like so he 
did this one really well I mean we got 
engaged right at the foot of the Eiffel 
Tower he had a professional photographer 
there to like capture all of the moments 
he told me we were just going out on a 
photo shoot 
so because I wanted to do that like you 
know a chance to wear a dress anytime 
right of course one of John's 30 dresses 
so he's like we'll just do a photo shoot 
um that was the reason for the 
photographer and so we both got dressed 
up and then we went we were taking a 
walk with the 
photographer and she's like why don't 
you just go over there like over there 
by the river and I'll get some pictures 
of you two together and I said no I 
don't want to because I thought Matthew 
was gonna pick me up and like anyway I 
was afraid I was gonna fall on the river 
so she's like no just trust me just go 
do it and I said okay I did and then I 
turned around and Matthew was already 
there and he was already down on one 
knee and he had the most amazing ring 
and asked me to marry him and it was 
beautiful it was epic in every way so 
but that's Matthew like he just knows 
how to do things really well he's all 
for celebrating life and living big and 
why not I mean life is short so 
um so we got engaged and now we're 
planning a wedding for this fall 
how beautiful and how do you feel did 
you ever think you'd be in this place 
no but you don't know what you don't 
know you know what's that saying uh God 
made the world round so you can't see 
too far ahead 
I love that thing because uh the good 
stuff the bad stuff all the stuff that 
comes along the way I mean really we 
don't know what's ahead and 
um 
and so that's my my big takeaway from 
from all of this I mean 
going through grief and losing Mike I 
mean it changed me as a person forever 
but 
I think it it made me a a better person 
and as I've continued to evolve through 
the whole grief process and opening my 
heart to new possibilities for the 
future I mean I was really reluctant to 
do that for a really long time you feel 
like I think when you're when you're in 
that grief process you kind of feel 
mistakenly like you're honoring the 
person that you lost by staying 
by suffering by staying stuck like 
somehow you're honoring 
them but that's not really true in my 
opinion I even though it feels like it 
at the time 
I feel like you honor them more by by 
living you know that's what I would want 
for Mike if I was the one who left 
before him and so I know he 
would want that for me and so anyway 
just but but again it's easy to say it 
in this place where I am now but I was 
nowhere close to where I am now back 
then you know several years ago right 
after I lost Mike so I think the other 
big takeaway is just 
if you're going through something like 
this and I suppose 
some of the people who you're working 
with you're probably working with a 
segment of that demographic or people 
who have lost spouses and yeah not 
something that they chose to have happen 
um you know just be patient with 
yourself like 
just be patient with yourself like 
you're gonna get there but just put one 
foot in front of the other and uh 
and allow yourself to evolve to that 
place where you're ready to do something 
new and it doesn't mean that you are 
um 
dishonoring the person that came before 
the new person I the the capacity of the 
human heart is amazing there's no limit 
on the love that you can give so 
just because I love someone else doesn't 
diminish the love I had for Mike in any 
way it's amazing There's No Limit 
there's no capacity 
so 
um so I'm just grateful that I can look 
back on the road that I've traveled 
and uh you know my my hope with my book 
is that I can help other people too like 
one of the things that really helped me 
when I was first going through grief was 
reading other people's stories it was so 
validating 
um because all these other people around 
me 
they wanted to help me I was surrounded 
by friends and family who loved me 
dearly but they really weren't they 
hadn't gone through what I had gone 
through 
um they just weren't in a place where 
they could meet me 
where I was in this grief tunnel 
and by reading the stories of other 
people who had gone through grief it was 
so validating it made me feel like I 
wasn't alone so that's what I did with 
my book is I just wanted to help other 
people 
um 
I wanted to help other people like other 
people helped me and 
so really those were the three things 
that helped me the most 
um I think get through grief was 
you know just 
helping other people was was probably 
one of the most cathartic things well 
writing writing was an important way for 
me to process my grief and then helping 
other people and then also finding ways 
to honor Mike so like all the proceeds 
of any of my book sales it's all going 
to charity so I just wanted to mention 
that too because 
um I I wanted to honor Mike in some way 
so that allowed me to 
by helping other people I feel like I'm 
honoring him kind of doing it in his 
name 
well what you're doing and it gives me 
goosebumps is not is all coming from 
that place of love it was loving 
yourself and letting yourself tell your 
story and to pay it forward 
to the people that would walk through 
grief and they don't even know that it 
might be coming that that's going to be 
part of their story because the Giants 
that lifted you up probably have no idea 
that their words and their stories 
lifted you up so you are doing God's 
work I'm going to put a link to Dawn's 
breathtaking story called The Darkness 
and the stars by Don Anderson in the 
book I couldn't be prouder of you for 
who you are as a human being and just 
the um 
I ca I still kind I I'm I'm rendered 
speechless not very often I don't know 
what I must have done right to have 
someone like you in my life and be able 
to hold your hand through your journey 
and wrap you in pink sparkly bubble wrap 
but I'm just I'm so grateful I knew from 
the first call we had back in 2019 that 
you got into my heart in less than an 
hour I was like and I think I would just 
ping you in between like hey it's Stella 
from Smart dating Academy just checking 
on you and before you had even made the 
leap because you have that um that you 
are like a giant walking heart and to 
know you is to love you and 
um thank you for trusting me through the 
process thank you Bella I can't tell you 
how grateful I am for you thank you I 
think sometimes people are put in their 
life for a reason and I believe that 
so I'm so grateful that I have you in my 
life and thank you for holding my hand 
and helping me get through that really I 
can't say enough about it 
oh well I can't wait to see wedding 
pictures and is there any parting words 
of advice you'd want to give the single 
people that are coming through the 
tunnel 
hmm 
just you know 
people be patient with yourself like be 
really patient with the whole evolution 
of grief it's real tempting to kind of 
stagnate there and get lost 
um 
in that tunnel especially in the early 
stages of grief when it's all still so 
very 
Raw 
you don't have to have it all figured 
out I don't think I had the capacity to 
see beyond one step in front of me you 
know for a long time so be patient with 
yourself and don't lose hope I mean 
there is a giant world out there and you 
can honor the person 
that you lost by living like that's the 
best way to do it and and helping other 
people is probably one of the best ways 
I help that that helped me cope so um 
yeah don't lose hope and uh and be 
patient with yourself 
oh I love that well thank you so much 
for sharing with us that you can have 
one lid to your pot and you can 
certainly find another it's going to be 
a different lid you might have gone from 
a red lid to a green lid or a cast iron 
lid to a tempered glass lid but there 
can be more than one lid to your pot 
more than one soul mate and again to 
support Dawn and the foundation that she 
set up for Mike and all of her proceeds 
will go to charity help my friend out 
and buy her book and share it with 
anybody that you know that is going 
through grief share this episode with 
anybody who is going through grief 
because if somebody has lived to tell 
and exercised that muscle of resilience 
and been to Hell and back more than 
almost any other human I know it's you 
so thank you for being here and thank 
you for writing your book and thank you 
for sharing your story and I think we're 
going to have you on again to talk about 
married life ah 
honor One Foot In Front of the other 
Absolutely I'll be here all right well I 
love you Dawn thank you for being here I 
love you fellas thank you so much it's 
an honor
