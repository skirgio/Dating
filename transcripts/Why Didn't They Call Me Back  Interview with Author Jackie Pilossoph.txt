smartdators welcome back I'm happy to 
have Jackie pilasoff with us the creator 
of the divorce girls smiling Community I 
want you all to get your notebooks out 
because we're going to be talking about 
the top 10 possible reasons why you 
didn't hear back from someone you 
thought you had a good date with I think 
there's a lot of pain out there from 
women who are dating and you know when 
someone doesn't call back it feels very 
personal and it feels very awful and you 
think to yourself your first gut 
instinct is what did I do what did I do 
wrong and that's something I hope today 
Bella you and I can tell people that 
it's not you there are so many other 
reasons why you might not have called
