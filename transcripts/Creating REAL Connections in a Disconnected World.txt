if I were to ask anybody right now 
considering getting into a relationship 
here's the thing I think you should 
answer why is your perspective partner 
lucky to have 
you what do you bring to this person why 
you of the billions of people on this 
planet what are you going to bring to 
their life and in that for me often 
really flips the script in terms of I'm 
I'm looking to you know are they going 
to like me am I enough am I too fat am I 
too smart am I too skinny am I too dumb 
am I are they going to love my three 
children you know whatever these things 
I come with all this baggage who's ever 
going to love me bull I think that so 
much of that is how do I what what what 
is good about you then if you can't 
answer that question nobody else is 
going to find 
it
