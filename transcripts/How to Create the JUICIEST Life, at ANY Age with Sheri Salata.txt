sparkle floating everywhere right now 
because today I'm bringing on the 
amazing the one and only Sherry Salata 
and I know for those of you guys who 
have followed us for a long time you've 
heard me Sherry this Sherry that 
Sherry's amazing and so now Sherry is 
here to talk to us about her own Journey 
as a woman as a very professional Woman 
as a high octane woman who is now a 
transformational doula and has her own 
company but wait for it spent 20 years 
in the world of Oprah one let's just say 
when Oprah was Oprah when everybody in 
the world wanted to sit on that couch 
Sherry was The Wizard Of The Wizard of 
Oz and so Sherry thank you for being 
here with us hello we should tell 
everybody Bella and I are friends we're 
we're real close I was not The Wizard of 
Oz Bella I know I like to brag on my 
friends too but um you know I was an 
amazing team and a once in a lifetime 
ride and it set me up it set me up for 
my life now and I'm I'm so 
Beyond appreciative that I had that 
crazy crazy all-consuming experience 
I mean I can't even imagine what that 
was like behind the scenes of that show 
I've been behind the scenes of many 
shows and seen a little bit of the 
Dynamics but that was like the show of 
show of shows of our lifetime 
that was you know it's almost like 
there was so much Divinity in that so 
much Divine coming together everybody 
was there for a reason to make their 
contribution the the the the women of 
the world at that moment in time asked 
for support asked to be seen and boom 
next thing you know there was it and 
it's kind of the older days in Media 
you know there wasn't a big 5 000 cable 
channels and streaming and no no and all 
that so it was just like who can like 
can I turn on a channel and listen to 
something that makes me feel better and 
that really was the Oprah show it really 
had 
um it was on a Divine mission 
so it was great and hard and crazy all 
of it 
and Sharon and I were reminiscing before 
we turned the microphones on we are 
great friends dear friends and have been 
for years and we were actually the first 
person that connected me to share to 
Sherry was my friend Debbie Phillips of 
women on fire and Sherry's great friends 
with Debbie and I am and Debbie just 
said oh Bella Sherry gave an amazing 
keynote at the women on Fire Conference 
I think you two need to know each other 
and when Debbie gave me the little 
booklet because she used to do these fun 
books about like every person that came 
to a conference in their interview and I 
remember reading your story and thinking 
I love the Moxie from this girl from 
Waukegan Illinois because little fact 
known Sherry and I were both born in 
Waukegan Illinois up near the Wisconsin 
border but Sherry tell us how did you 
get your foot in the door at the Oprah 
show because this is just a story 
Instagram it's the craziest well you 
know what it is is the story of it's the 
story of the girl who is not in 
alignment who wanted so much and just 
kept going about it the hard way and so 
um I actually went to the University of 
Iowa as a lot of Chicago area people do 
and graduated with no plan in place of 
course I was going to be a doctor then a 
lawyer then of this then a that so 
finally the truth is I um in my late 20s 
I finally got a big break 
after having a myriad of different jobs 
and a a great guy taught me how to be an 
executive producer he taught me how to 
produce but we were doing advertising 
television commercials and so I applied 
at that Oprah Show thinking I think I'd 
really like to do that and I got 
rejected and it was a few years later 
than when I got a um a message on my 
answering machine that 
um hey we were cleaning out a closet we 
found your reel in your resume will you 
come in and freelance and I was 35 Bella 
oh my God 35 I was broke I was depressed 
I was like I'm never gonna have the life 
of my dreams or the job of my dreams and 
you know I give it to myself I just 
would not give up 
I was not going to sell out I would not 
give up I knew that my work was supposed 
to be a mission and I knew it was 
supposed to be take all of me and I knew 
it was supposed to be really fun and 
really exciting and so I hung in there 
until I until the door opened oh my gosh 
and now you said you wanted to be a 
doctor and all kinds of things was being 
a TV producer was that ever in your your 
potential bailiwick of ideas or no no no 
it wasn't it should have been because 
you know I was putting on plays with my 
little cousins as my cast and you know 
making the aunts and uncles be the 
audience and I was doing I was producing 
from my earliest memory but I didn't 
even think that was a thing like I 
wasn't connected I wasn't hooked up I 
didn't know anybody who knew anybody 
um I wasn't to the manor born as they 
say 
um and so I just thought it was out of 
my graph but I did want to be something 
which is why the doctor thing and then 
the lawyer thing I'm like that's 
something that's that's you've got a 
nice briefcase and you wear a nice 
little suit to work and you know I was 
I was on a search on a search for what 
is who am I supposed to be and what am I 
supposed to do 
wow and Along Comes this opportunity and 
now you're working at the advertising 
company you get this real from or and 
they find you real and they're like do 
you want to come in and so what do you 
do 
yeah well I actually was freelancing by 
that time and I was out of money and so 
what did I do when I read it was an 
actual on an actual answering machine 
with tape 
send that to them 
oh yeah the Smithsonian I wish I still 
had it for a while there I had the 
resume that had a woman named Harriet 
seitler from Highland Park had come in 
and taken over his creative Services 
director and she she had very high she 
had great taste and she didn't she 
didn't want to bring in another local TV 
person she goes you know let's look and 
find an advertising producer to come in 
and by the grace of God my reel was 
there and uh you know and then and so it 
began 
wow and and how tell us about your 
ascendancy 
yeah I mean 
there was no pus let me just put it this 
way 
there was no possibility that I was 
gonna ever be the executive producer or 
I was ever going to be a senior producer 
on the show that the structure wasn't 
made like that I was in the basement in 
the promo department and maybe I could 
become a senior promo producer but that 
was going to be it there there wasn't a 
lot of crossover between support 
departments and the the production team 
that actually did the show so there was 
no way no chance 
so nobody is more surprised than me than 
any of this took place at all and I will 
tell you they were all shocked as well 
so uh you know it's again there's so 
much about the experience 
you know from in a global view which is 
you know divine order that this must 
have been a little piece of that too 
because it shouldn't have happened I 
never thought it would happen and then 
and but it did 
wow and the girl from the basement 
became the girl with the corner office 
yes 
yes amazing a little hard work a little 
hustle and you know if I can ask you 
this I'm sure you're asked this a 
thousand times what's your favorite 
Oprah story or your Oprah's show story 
so many and and and you know Bella to be 
honest most of it's a blur it was crazy 
it was it was fast just a moral and it 
was crazy and 
um you know it was fun doing those Oscar 
shows the morning after the Oscars we 
took the whole audience to Australia for 
a few weeks I love Australia so much we 
you know put a Big Red O on the Sydney 
Harbor Bridge I mean so many things and 
and you know probably the the last shows 
the shows at the United Center 
which were huge and and challenging to 
do 
um so so many things you know I and I 
liked it all you know I like this silly 
stuff I liked the important meaningful 
stuff I like the educational stuff I 
like the spiritual stuff and I probably 
most like the spiritual stuff because I 
really feel like that experience it was 
like being paid to build a spiritual 
life 
it was exposure to new thought leaders 
and thinking that I I never I never 
would have I don't think I would ever 
would have ever come across it 
so it was a transformative path for me 
for sure 
and and and and and let me say this 
and turns out it was just the foundation 
for what came next 
and there's no such thing as Glory Days 
unless you make it so but now I see that 
was the thing that led to this that led 
to this that led to this and so now I 
say oh all that got me ready for 
something else 
wow so in the background you're hustling 
you're sparkling you're doing all of 
this you moved to California and now the 
bricks are being laid for something else 
unbeknownst to you what was the moment 
that you sort of said wow I think 
something else is out there for me and 
how did you make that pivot I think 
everything has its time I think it was 
time it was time time time 
um I I you know to be honest I didn't 
particularly love the Cable business 
um and as you can see as it's changing 
so rapidly I mean it's a hard business 
really really hard and 
um you know I I had the you know one of 
the top seats and the worst job 
um you know and and it was far away from 
the things I really loved so 
um and also I was tired yeah I was a lot 
tired and maybe even a little sad 
and so it was it was the end it was the 
end it was time and it launched you know 
what it did was 
it was time for everybody all the way 
around to move on and what it did was it 
gave me this breath and this pause to 
kind of do a process that I now call the 
Reckoning 
which is 
okay 
you have been on a terror 
for 20 years 
how's it going 
do you like like your life 
do you like what you've created 
and you know it was very much the dream 
come true career but not the dream come 
true life 
and so that was like whoa okay I 
remember I did this exercise that you 
know all all the biggies would had some 
something similar to this which was 
called I call it the tombstone exercise 
and it's like what would your Tombstone 
say right now wow and mine was Sherry 
still here lies Sherry Salata she had a 
great job for a long time 
wow and I was like hmm that's not 
exactly what I would like but I got time 
to change it and and that's that those 
are the Glad Tidings that I bring to 
everybody listening today to realize 
okay that's where I'm headed 
I got time to change this and what I 
want my Tombstone to say is here lies 
Sherry Salata she lived the full-on 
joyride 
so I mean that's really where I'm at 
today 
um I I am I really keep my focus Bella 
on 
simple easy be in flow don't try to make 
anything happen allow it to happen watch 
for the breadcrumbs 
um you know the universe is laying down 
breadcrumbs 
get quiet 
look for them look for the signs listen 
to The Whispers do it like really really 
allow the universe to guide you 
to everything you say you want and for 
such a 
for a person who got so rewarded for 
making things happen it's a lot of new 
patterning I still have to do for myself 
I still have to say hold on hold on 
let's not do it the old way 
what is it you really want what's in 
your heart can you slow your role here 
and allow it to happen 
and 
um that has brought me 
to this moment 
where I can tell you 
in no uncertain terms I have never been 
more on purpose 
more filled with joy more in love with 
my life and myself than I am right now 
oh who else has goosebumps head ever 
right now and and so many of you 
listening to this are at these junctures 
in your life and maybe 
you're you're holding down and you're 
pushing down on that Reckoning that 
Sherry's talking about because you know 
so many of you are you know I work with 
you you're doctors your lawyers your 
blah blah blahs your blah blahs and 
you're the good girl and you've been in 
the Box you're the good boy and you've 
been in the box and you know there's 
something more to it and one of my 
favorite quotes ever is change happens 
in an instant it doesn't take years to 
make these decisions right those 
inflection points in our lives come as 
soon as we let them to some extent so 
you let your Reckoning happen and for 
someone and if you're sitting there 
driving a car you're on the elliptical 
or you're doing whatever it is 
understand how inspiring just this bit 
is is someone who have like 
the top seat next to the queen of two 
decades now downshifted pivoted start 
started her own business and says I've 
never had a juicier more joyful life I 
mean that chair big hug and high five 
over the screen and I know and what's so 
beautiful now is you've written a book 
about 
all of it and you're teaching people how 
to do what you did have their Reckoning 
so talk to us first about the book and 
then tell us about the work that you've 
done in your teaching others to do 
because it's unbelievable 
well the beautiful no which is my Memoir 
really is about all the pitfalls the 
mistakes 
um the the all the ways that I I went 
around things the hard way so for for 
for younger people I I say it's a 
cautionary tale 
or people my age I say it's a rallying 
cry because that's what I'm saying it's 
not too late I tell you right now I've 
never been happier more fulfilled more 
on purpose and I promise you my plan and 
intention is for two years from now to 
be able to say that again 
because I'm going to keep expanding I'm 
going to keep manifesting I'm going to 
keep calling it in I'm going to keep 
releasing releasing shame and and all 
the things the limiting beliefs that 
keep us stuck and you know I continue I 
I'm in this work 24 7. and I still have 
things come up where I'm like where'd 
that come from why am I triggered about 
that why am I why do I even care about 
that 
and um so you know what I what I see is 
until my last breath 
I'm gonna be creating and innovating and 
releasing and expanding and healing 
so now that I know that 
what else can I make space for 
and when you when you I call it doing 
the work but it's really not work Bella 
it's just really you know creating new 
practices and patterns that keep your 
feet on the path of transformation 
and as long as your feet are on the path 
it means you're focused on where you 
want to go 
and and not always brooding about what 
isn't arrived yet what what haven't you 
what haven't you solved for yet 
um 
and I want to keep my feet on the path 
because as long as I do that I know I 
know I am transcending 
I know that I am 
um casting a light 
for others 
which is what the gift we can all give 
one another and others are casting a 
light for me 
I love that I love that and if you're if 
you could give 
uh our listeners something if they're 
like wow I feel like the reckoning's 
bubbling up I'm listening to Sherry I 
can feel the lava juice I can feel it 
sort of coming up how do you start the 
work how do you even answer the question 
so many of us have been in service we're 
givers we've stopped we're producing 
everybody else's lives we don't even 
know what we want one of the questions I 
want I always ask is what do you want 
how do you recommend people start the 
work yeah 
um 
first of all 
make a promise to yourself to be not 
afraid wow you're afraid it is fear 
that robs us of our last two or three 
decades be not afraid there's nothing to 
be afraid of 
um 
make a friend of change 
because change is coming people are 
going to come and people are going to go 
and you'll you'll be okay with that 
you'll get through that as long as you 
as long as you've formed a new 
relationship with yourself 
there's nothing you can't transcend 
um I think the the way to get started is 
to number one make a I like to call them 
governing decisions so this isn't just a 
little fly-by-night decision this is a 
governing decision that I 
it is not too late for me 
oh I love to create the life I say I 
want 
and once you make that governing 
decision 
the universe shows up in interesting 
ways you know 
there are a million things that that can 
happen for you but the phone will ring 
someone will be like hey do you want to 
go for a walk 
kind of going through your life and 
saying I need to add more movement I 
need to add more water I need to add 
more plants I need to add a two-minute 
meditation I can do five times a day a 
little five deep breaths and do things 
these create your practices so small 
that you know you could do those 
practices every day for the rest of your 
life 
and that's the beginning 
and day after day after day you start to 
feel a little better and you start to 
feel a little bit more like the life 
manager you must become of yourself 
become the steward of your own 
well-being nobody else is going to do it 
some guys I know guys they're they're 
like Legends but they wrote a book 
um and and I don't remember oh who's in 
the room who's in your room who's in 
your room and and the premise is this 
that you're the also the bouncer why do 
you just have an open door and anybody 
can get in you're the bouncer 
now everybody should be in your room not 
a and you shouldn't be saying yes to 
everything and you you know how do you 
start setting boundaries I find for 
women in the middle to late middle of 
life 
it's gonna be it's gonna be it's gonna 
be a hard thing to face but most of your 
relationships are codependent 
yeah now you've just been raised by 
people who weren't trained and they were 
raised by people who weren't trained 
and all this information this Leading 
Edge therapeutic information spiritual 
information has shown us now that we are 
not to be serving everybody and not 
ourselves 
that there's nothing spiritual about 
that in fact you just end up stuffing 
down your resentment totally 
and really killing yourself it's the 
death of Dreams so so it's just 
beginning to beginning to 
help yourself uncover 
The Knowing inside that there is more 
for you 
that it is possible and that you are 
worthy of more joy more love more 
expansion more fun more Adventure and 
the only thing standing in your way is 
you 
um 
say it again for the people in the back 
the only thing standing in the in your 
way is you and that means that's very 
good news because you can say I'm not 
standing in my way anymore yeah I'm 
gonna let it flow I'm gonna let it all 
in I'm gonna start dreaming again and 
I'm gonna believe again and I'm gonna 
stir that pot of Hope and get it going 
um 
I and I can feel myself like bubbling 
with the things that you're saying with 
with positivity it's like get rid of the 
fear what makes it a little peace get 
get a little piece you start stirring 
that pot of hope maybe I could why can't 
I maybe I could maybe I could you get a 
little piece of that a little hold on 
that 
next thing you know you're Off to the 
Races and next thing you know like your 
mind is just taking you into 
possibilities and potential and you know 
things you could do and the kind of work 
you can create and the kind of love you 
can have and the kind of relationships 
you really want in your life not the 
ones that suck you dry the ones that 
elevate you and lift you up 
oh oh 
um 
oh I love that I love that and I can 
feel this washing over me and I know I I 
heart your title at the beginning your 
transformation Doula I mean it's obvious 
you're showing us and not telling us 
what you do because I can I'm sure the 
molecules and everybody right now are 
like oh my God it's possible for me I 
could do this what is the transformation 
Doula I know what is your work in the 
world now with people 
well I do not choose to be an expert 
and I I I I've seen them all and every 
one of them a good portion of them and 
here's what I see what what I I see that 
it's a difficult Road when you cast 
yourself in that light so what I say is 
I am on the path 
and I'm putting out my elbows and if you 
want to link arms with me and walk down 
that path 
then let's go and so what is that what 
does that look like it's more like 
um 
I've taken some steps I've done it 
myself 
and I've done a lot of things so Let Me 
Shine the Light a little bit so I'll let 
me be your Doula so what what does that 
look like it's it's very much evolved 
I can't believe it I mean like two years 
ago I didn't know I'd be doing any of 
this and it's just been very much 
inspired and divinely divinely led and 
um a co-creation and I do a digital 
course called 
um change your story change your life 
that's 12 I do it live workshops for 12 
weeks and I do it twice a year I'm in 
the middle of my latest cohort right now 
I have a private membership group for 
women called the support system where I 
bring in experts like Miss Bella and uh 
we 
um we keep ourselves on the path 
together so I get to Duo some producing 
bringing in experts having events 
um it's it has the advantages of of 
social media but it's not it's off 
Facebook it's off everything it's 
private it's it's a big old Global 
Sacred Circle for sure 
and then I do some trips you know for 
for people who want to go and have not 
only an adventure but an Awakening 
um I do some things like that so I'm 
just really doing what I want to do 
Bella 
I love this well you're everybody's 
transformational Doula including mine so 
I 
um yeah I just love being in your 
presence and I'm so I'm so glad that you 
were doing the work that you're doing 
not only for others but that like you 
said you're linking arms you're putting 
your elbows out and saying come join me 
I'm not perfect I'm still transforming 
and I will continue to transform more to 
do while I'm in this body more to do 
because there's more to do because as 
you start to build this new life new 
things appear and you're like oh I also 
want to learn that I want to go in that 
direction I want to live here and as you 
gain the courage when you get rid of 
those mind monkeys and those cement 
blocks of fear right all of a sudden the 
world is your oyster and if you can hear 
this right Sherry is not 21 years old or 
31 and she's transforming her life over 
50 right right so if you're sitting 
there going oh my God I'm 50. wow 58 
what it used to be okay you know what it 
used to be yeah I started this when I 
was 56. and I still feel like I'm just 
like I'm just getting going you know you 
and I were talking 
um off mic before before we started that 
what this has allowed me to do I mean 
obviously work has been my thing to the 
exclusion of a lot of other things 
um to the exclusion of love to the 
exclusion of creating a family other 
than my four-leggeds and because I was 
good at it and it it it it 
answered some wounds too because you 
know for for a lot of us and you you 
guys can all have this conversation with 
yourself 
um do you equate achievement with 
worthiness 
you know for some of us that started in 
the second grade with the first spelling 
bee and and papers getting graded do you 
do you equate achievement with 
worthiness well guess what that was a 
big surprise to me that was in 
2019 when I was out on my book tour and 
I was like oh my God I have a terrible I 
put those things as the same thing it's 
it it it it's so not true right I've 
been telling myself that life forever 
which is why you get to the top of the 
mountain of achievement and you're like 
well this ain't all that right why am I 
not super happy 
I'm just kind of like hmm 
which happens to a lot of people in the 
middle of life whether you've had a big 
career like mine or you raised a family 
and all that that means and you're like 
well here I am is that all there is 
right and my and I understand that 
feeling I understand that feeling and my 
answer to that is 
no 
um no 
put your hands on the wheel open your 
heart and open your mind and start 
dreaming there's more there's so much 
more and you can be happier and more on 
purpose and more filled with joy than 
ever before and I haven't even conjured 
my mate yet the lid to my pot yet Bella 
okay Cher let's go there now what's 
where 
you and I talked a few weeks ago and you 
said Bell 
2023 I'm feeling it I'm feeling I've 
done some warm-up dating which was that 
was a big step to even to put on a heel 
and some lipstick and get out of the 
house so I've done a little warm-up 
dating and here's what I realize I've 
healed enough where it isn't I I'm not 
psychotic on a date that's was like I 
don't I don't want to reactivate that 
psychotic woman I was in my 30s 
um where I'm always mostly interested in 
what won't pursue me and what will 
pursue me I'm like 
um but I'm like I'm not psychotic 
anymore this is just a lovely meeting of 
another human being and a sip of wine 
and something to eat so I've I've calmed 
myself I see that I've done enough 
healing that 
I won't reactivate that old behavior 
that I did not enjoy 
the second thing I want to say is that 
and this has been a really recent Bella 
maybe even like the last four or five 
months it's like I see that I'm creating 
space 
I'm I see that I'm creating space I'm 
slowing some things down I'm simplifying 
some things 
to create space 
that gives me the opportunity to think 
about what I want what do I want in an 
intimate partnership 
I have space to to Noodle on that in a 
way that I'm like well I can't think 
about that now I've got all this stuff 
to do so and that's really just 
self-protective 
so it's just like let's just create some 
space 
here's what we know you can have what 
you want 
to have one so let's just start to 
create some space and call that in and 
so who knows Bella I might be down doing 
some pictures with you in 2023 at Cher 
Smart dating Academy always has a VIP 
spot for you my friend and and I know 
for a fact that when you and I first 
connected was it 2016 when was Bellevue 
16 yeah seven years ago yeah your first 
volley to me is yeah I'm not ready for 
what you do we'll talk about it on my 
podcast but I'm not I'm not here slow 
down lady slow down lady right here and 
and so now for me to hear this and I'm 
never I'm Not The Pusher of anybody 
you're ready for this you don't know it 
right because people need to have their 
own Journeys and when people come I had 
some healing to do Bella for sure I had 
I had some healing to do 
um and and knew that that it's like uh 
brother I'm just I'm just coming out of 
a fog 
um I have some healing to do and and yet 
you know I'm also checking myself 
I'm also checking myself like don't keep 
putting that off 
so just get in the pool just get in the 
pool already and see what it is you want 
you know and you're not going to be 
robbed of your you know 
um 
I don't know I I I've you know like like 
where do you get these Notions you know 
I watched my parents when I was little 
and my mom had the had the worst end of 
the bargain 
she was like 
the family made the family babysitter 
the family Cook and her job was 24 7. I 
was like absolutely not unpaid unpaid 
and like my dad would saunter in and you 
know God bless him and he'd sit down and 
you know he Disturbed why he watches the 
news and you know and golfs on the 
weekends and my mom's still working I 
was like that is a shitty bargain yeah 
so you know some of those those 
formative things really did a number on 
me so I have to unpack that and say no 
no no no you're a grown ass woman you 
can make your own agreements yes none 
you know for partnership you can really 
have those conversations and make your 
own agreements 
so that's what I say I mean healing 
making space 
getting excited 
um seeing seeing how that could be 
that's like the next version of My Life 
and I mean just what I'm telling you I 
can't even imagine being more joyful 
more appreciative more on purpose but I 
guess I can 
yeah I guess that's I guess that's the 
next level 
100 and here's what I would tell you 
people often come to this place where 
gosh I'm so happy finally on my own like 
do I do I want someone do I need 
somebody I'm like well as humans we're 
sort of driven to pair bond right we 
kind of like that one person and I will 
tell you what you said it correctly the 
right person the lid to your pot will be 
an and to your beautiful life it's not 
an or it's not if I find a man old bad 
story is I'm going to become the nurse 
in the purse right that is not what 
you're going to become this can be a 
beautiful partnership with someone who I 
don't know if you remember this we 
talked about this on the podcast on your 
podcast years ago when I came to LA and 
I still have this vision for you where 
you have met the lid to your pot and I'm 
closing my eyes because I can visualize 
it so perfectly and 
your boo is standing in the back of the 
room he's got a tuxedo on he looks 
dashing and Dapper and he's elbowing the 
guy next to him and he's like and you're 
up on the stage you've got the mic 
because you're transformationally 
dueling all of us at this point and 
you're wearing sequins and you're 
sparkling and he point he elbows the guy 
next to me he's like can you believe 
I got her 
and he's beaming and he's proud and he's 
like I swam out of my Lane look at that 
and he couldn't be prouder of you and 
that is who's waiting for you 
that is the dream my friend that is the 
dream and yes I think that's possible 
I know it's possible and I'm here for 
all of it because that's the 
transformational 
doulaing that I do so that's why that's 
right girl that is 100 
possible for you and the fact that I'm 
hearing you say 2023 I'm feeling I'm 
feeling the bubbly things coming up 
great and I hope that listening to 
Sherry for you dear listener who might 
be driving and maybe you've been 
listening to this podcast for a year and 
you're like man I don't know I've got 
some work to do do the work have your 
Reckoning let it Bubble Up no there is 
hope for you look at what Sherry has 
done with her life right pivoted more 
joyful than ever did more work while 
creating that joy and is now saying I 
think I could find the lid to my pot and 
I think that there many Lids to my pot 
and they could be in all these different 
zip codes but isn't that exciting and I 
get to just go out and date and meet new 
friends and it's low stakes and I'm not 
chasing and nobody's chasing me and this 
is going to feel peaceful and lovely and 
that is my that is how your love Journey 
will go that's how it will go it will be 
very easy because that's how everything 
is going now I just I just won't get in 
the heart and on the Hard Road anymore I 
know what that hard road is it's a lot 
of 
um a lot of pushing and maneuvering and 
manipulating and you know talking into 
and the Hard Road is no fun and it and 
it's not it's it's it's 
it's not it's false excitement 
you know because we're like wow that's 
so easy maybe that's not so exciting

most exciting thing I've ever I've ever 
experienced it's so exciting and the 
phone rings or you run into somebody or 
you pick up and have the perfect answer

and and that's why I will be right along 
your side because we want to make sure
