I know it feels for a lot of you that 
we're hearing that there's kind of a 
lull Peak dating season is now over what 
can I do to ramp things up for my dating 
life so what I wanted to talk to you 
today about are seven small changes that 
you can make starting today that can 
potentially lead to Big results so you 
can make some of these small changes to 
start to get big results and remember 
just because you make a small change 
today doesn't mean you're going to get a 
big result today you've got to have the 
mindset of dating as a marathon it's not 
a Sprint and my small change today could 
lead to the love of my life
