and the first thing is is to answer the 
questions or look at make a list of what 
do you have now 
and what do you want and look at where 
the gaps are because that's 
that's the gaps are where you need to 
let go so it's really figuring out if 
you are here 
if you are single 
or divorced and you want love you want 
to get here 
what is in between you and single and 
love 
that is standing between you make a list 
of what those things are 
what you think they are are they your 
kids are they 
you know shared friendships are they the 
pressures of convention are they 
internal limiting beliefs which are huge 
like i'm too fat to find love again i 
find love again um i'm too 
um i don't choose well to find love 
again i'm not lucky you know fate wants 
me to be single it's a sign from the 
universe that i'm not supposed to be 
with anyone like what are those things i 
call them let goabbles
